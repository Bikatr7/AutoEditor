Yamamura Miki's Monologue
I find myself alone before I know it.
It isn't that I am particularly disliked by anyone.
I just don't catch anyone's eye.
I am inconspicuous, lacking presence.
I can't even be disliked, let alone liked.
That's why I am always alone.
It is the same in kindergarten, elementary school, and junior high school.
I don't have any real friends, and I spend a lot of time alone.
I can't develop the ability to talk to people, and I remain invisible.
Even after becoming a high school student, that doesn't change.
But I think that is okay.
I force myself to believe that this is my strength...
I think it will be okay to live quietly alone, even as an adult.
But still---I am definitely here.
"...After all... I think losing to Sakayanagi-san doesn't suit you..."
"Why don't you try telling her? No one has the right to criticize your actions."
What is this feeling, this emotion that seeps into my heart?
I don't know.
I didn't know.
I just didn't know.
---Until this day.

The Elusive Two-Party Interview
A little time had passed since the special test of survival and dropout ended.
Kamuro becomes a new dropout student, due to her close position to Sakayanagi, which surprises the second-year students, but Kamuro doesn't have any close friends in other classes, so the impact doesn't last long.
But that isn't the only factor. The effect of getting used to it can't be ignored.
We are gradually becoming insensitive to the pain of losing our friends.
As soon as February begins, the date and details of the two-party interview that have been announced are communicated.
Over five days, we have a 15-minute discussion per person. The time needed for the interview is secured by making the afternoon classes self-study and using after-school hours, and students are called to a separate room as needed.
The view from the classroom window shows the sun beginning to set.
Today is the last day of the fifth day, and it is the day of my two-party interview, which is assigned to the last slot.
While waiting in the classroom, I received instructions from the teacher on my phone to come to the career counseling room, so I decided to go immediately. There were hardly any students left in the school, and the only ones I occasionally passed were students returning from club activities.
When I arrived in front of the career counseling room, I lightly clenched my hand and used the first joint of my fingers to lightly knock three times to signal my arrival. Naturally, I received permission to enter from Chabashira-sensei.
"Excuse me."
After calling out, I quietly opened the door to see the teacher sitting at her desk, running her fingertips over her tablet.
"You're here. Sit here."
After briefly glancing at me, she said that and returned her gaze to the tablet.

"You seem busy."
"As a homeroom teacher, I can't help but be busy at this time of year. However, I feel a bit relieved now that the parent-teacher meetings are over today. It was a good decision to leave the two oddballs for last."
After answering, I was instructed to sit down, so I sat in the empty seat across the desk.
"The two oddballs... you mean?"
"Are you shocked to be treated on the same level as Kōenji?"
"I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me."
When I replied, Chabashira-sensei placed her tablet on the desk after a slight laugh.
"Do you think Kōenji is more of an oddball? Well, I can understand why you'd feel that way, but to me, there's not much difference. You're quite an oddball yourself."
It seemed that she thought so from a teacher's perspective.
I wanted to deny it, but I decided to hold back and let it slide.
"Well. I don't get many opportunities to talk with each student individually. Before we talk about your future plans, let's talk about your school life. If there's anything you want the school to improve on, please let me know."
"Nothing in particular. I'm satisfied as an individual."
"I see. Do you have any concerns about your relationships with friends, or anything you want to discuss?"
"None."
Without hesitation, I answered in quick succession, and Chabashira-sensei showed a slight bitter smile.
"Most students have one or two opinions, or at least show some consideration even if they don't. I don't think you're holding back..."
She seemed a little puzzled by my quicker-than-expected response, but there was nothing she could do.
"I don't have any complaints."
If I had any requests, I would probably have conveyed them without hesitation.
"Well, if that's the case, it's fine... Are you sure there's nothing?"
As a homeroom teacher, she seemed worried and kept checking.
"There's nothing. I'm satisfied with my school life and there's no particular trouble."
"I see... Well, that's very good."
She seemed unable to hide her concern, but for now, she seemed to trust the student's words. She typed this into her tablet.
"You've changed a lot, Chabashira-sensei."
Perhaps she felt that it made sense to her, as she showed a bitter smile with a sigh.
"I don't think I've changed. I've just become more honest than before."
The unanimous special exam she experiences as a student.
And the unanimous special exam she experiences as a teacher.
What she gains and loses from these two experiences.
At the beginning of the school year, it was nostalgic to think that I couldn't even imagine the teacher in front of me smiling.
"...Ahem. Anyway. If there's anything you're concerned about in your school life, don't hesitate to let me know."
"Understood."
