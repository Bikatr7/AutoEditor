〇Yamamura Miki's Monologue
 I found myself alone before I knew it.
 It wasn't that I was particularly disliked by anyone.
 I just didn't catch anyone's eye.
 I was inconspicuous, lacking presence.
 I couldn't even be disliked, let alone liked.
 That's why I was always alone.
 It was the same in kindergarten, elementary school, and junior high school.
 I didn't have any real friends, and I spent a lot of time alone.
 I couldn't develop the ability to talk to people, and I remained invisible.
 Even after becoming a high school student, that didn't change.
 But I thought that was okay.
 I forced myself to believe that this was my strength...
 I thought it would be okay to live quietly alone, even as an adult.
 But still---I am definitely here.
"...After all... I think losing to Sakayanagi-san doesn't suit you..."
"Why don't you try telling her? No one has the right to criticize your actions."
 What is this feeling, this emotion that seeps into my heart?
 I don't know.
 I didn't know.
 I just didn't know.
 ---Until this day.
〇The Elusive Two-Party Interview
 A little time had passed since the special test of survival and dropout ended.
 Kamuro's becoming a new dropout student, due to her close position to Sakayanagi, surprised the second-year students, but Kamuro didn't have any close friends in other classes, so the impact didn't last long.
 But that wasn't the only factor. The effect of getting used to it couldn't be ignored.
 We were gradually becoming insensitive to the pain of losing our friends.
 As soon as February began, the date and details of the two-party interview that had been announced were communicated.
 Over five days, we would have a 15-minute discussion per person. The time needed for the interview was secured by making the afternoon classes self-study and using after-school hours, and students were called to a separate room as needed.
 The view from the classroom window showed the sun beginning to set.
 Today was the last day of the fifth day, and it was the day of my two-party interview, which was assigned to the last slot.
 While waiting in the classroom, I received instructions from the teacher on my phone to come to the career counseling room, so I decided to go immediately. There were hardly any students left in the school, and the only ones I occasionally passed were students returning from club activities.
 When I arrived in front of the career counseling room, I lightly clenched my hand and used the first joint of my fingers to lightly knock three times to signal my arrival. Naturally, I received permission to enter from Chabashira-sensei.
"Excuse me."
 After calling out, I quietly opened the door to see the teacher sitting at her desk, running her fingertips over her tablet.
"You're here. Sit here."
 After briefly glancing at me, she said that and returned her gaze to the tablet.

"You seem busy."
"As a homeroom teacher, I can't help but be busy at this time of year. However, I feel a bit relieved now that the parent-teacher meetings are over today. It was a good decision to leave the two oddballs for last."
After answering, I was instructed to sit down, so I sat in the empty seat across the desk.
"The two oddballs... you mean?"
"Are you shocked to be treated on the same level as Kōenji?"
"I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me."
When I replied, Chabashira-sensei placed her tablet on the desk after a slight laugh.
"Do you think Kōenji is more of an oddball? Well, I can understand why you'd feel that way, but to me, there's not much difference. You're quite an oddball yourself."
It seemed that she thought so from a teacher's perspective.
I wanted to deny it, but I decided to hold back and let it slide.
"Well. I don't get many opportunities to talk with each student individually. Before we talk about your future plans, let's talk about your school life. If there's anything you want the school to improve on, please let me know."
"Nothing in particular. I'm satisfied as an individual."
"I see. Do you have any concerns about your relationships with friends, or anything you want to discuss?"
"None."
Without hesitation, I answered in quick succession, and Chabashira-sensei showed a slight bitter smile.
"Most students have one or two opinions, or at least show some consideration even if they don't. I don't think you're holding back..."
She seemed a little puzzled by my quicker-than-expected response, but there was nothing she could do.
"I don't have any complaints."
If I had any requests, I would probably have conveyed them without hesitation.
"Well, if that's the case, it's fine... Are you sure there's nothing?"
As a homeroom teacher, she seemed worried and kept checking.
"There's nothing. I'm satisfied with my school life and there's no particular trouble."
"I see... Well, that's very good."
She seemed unable to hide her concern, but for now, she seemed to trust the student's words. She typed this into her tablet.
"You've changed a lot, Chabashira-sensei."
Perhaps she felt that it made sense to her, as she showed a bitter smile with a sigh.
"I don't think I've changed. I've just become more honest than before."
The unanimous special exam she experienced as a student.
And the unanimous special exam she experienced as a teacher.
What she gained and lost from these two experiences.
At the beginning of the school year, it was nostalgic to think that I couldn't even imagine the teacher in front of me smiling.
"...Ahem. Anyway. If there's anything you're concerned about in your school life, don't hesitate to let me know."
"Understood."
When I answered clearly, the preliminary conversation ended in a short time, and we moved on to the main topic of the parent-teacher meeting.
"I'd like to know whether you're considering going on to higher education or getting a job. If you've made up your mind, please let me know."
For high school students, this crossroads is a major turning point in life.
That's why teachers must show students the right path so they don't get lost.
However, I probably won't be able to meet Chabashira-sensei's expectations.
"I think my relatives will decide what to do about my future. I don't think there's anything to discuss here."
"Your relatives will decide. In other words, you'll follow your father's opinion?"
The school data shows that my mother is not present.
"Yes."
"I see. It's a rare case, but it's not uncommon for students to prioritize their parents' wishes. However, usually, they inform in advance whether they want to go on to higher education or get a job. This school always accepts communication from parents, and there are many cases where parents convey their thoughts to their children. However, so far, we have not received any consultation about going on to higher education or getting a job from your family."
It's true that it would be strange if the direction was not set even if I was to follow my parents.
But I, who won't go on to higher education or get a job, don't need that notification.
However, it's impossible for Chabashira-sensei to read that situation.
"There's no problem."
"You say there's no problem... If you want to go on to higher education, you need to start moving now. You need to work on taking exams that match the level of the university you want to go to---"

Chabashira-sensei started talking as if she was amazed, but she stopped speaking. 
Then she straightened her posture and met my eyes. 
"I don't know much about your past. I regret trying to use it as if I knew about it before. But now, as a homeroom teacher, I want to fully understand the abilities of the students I'm in charge of. That's my duty."
"I understand. I have no intention of interfering."
I couldn't see the screen of the tablet well because it was reflecting, but if the fields that each student should fill in were blank when submitted to the school, Chabashira-sensei would be the one to blame.
Also, depending on the school, whether a student's career path is realized, whether they were able to go to a high-level university or find a job, sometimes it is connected to the teacher's grades and evaluations.
"Then tell me. If your parents wish for you to go on to higher education, can I judge that you have the ability to meet that expectation?"
No matter how I answered, the future wouldn't change.
But it would be cruel to unnecessarily lower the evaluation because of someone like me, who is impure.
It would be best to give Chabashira-sensei a fruitful answer as much as possible.
"I think I can pass any university."
"...I see. Normally, I would warn you for such a ridiculous statement, but since it's you saying it, it must be true. I can understand that much."
Without denying it, Chabashira-sensei continued.
"It seems you've received quite an exceptional education. If you have such a clear head that you can assert without hesitation, I wish you would contribute more to the class on a regular basis... but let's not worry about that this time."
After typing what we had just talked about into the tablet, Chabashira-sensei looked up.
"I understand the current situation. But Ayanokōji, what is your opinion? While understanding your parents' wishes, don't you have a future vision you want to aim for within yourself?"
"I don't. Even if I did, unfortunately, I don't have the right to decide."
Regarding that, it would be a meaningless discussion to take time.
"I'm sorry. It might have been an impolite question."
"I don't mind. In fact, I just don't have any dreams or hopes at the moment. If I find something I want to aim for in the future, I'll consult with you."
"I see. So for now, you'll follow your parents' wishes. Then the three-way interview will be held during the spring break after the end of the third semester. Is it okay to officially decide on your career path at that time?"
"That's right."
However, a three-way interview involving parents is unlikely to happen.
At most, that man's messenger will come and have a meaningless conversation, which is obvious.
There's no way he would mention anything related to the White Room.
"The three-way interview with Ayanokōji is currently scheduled for April 1st. You'll be meeting your father for the first time in a while, Hisashi-shi. If necessary, we can also allocate more time. I want you to consider it a good opportunity to talk freely about your career path."
She spoke as if she believed without a doubt that my parents would come.
Or, is that actually the case?
"...Can I ask you something?"
Although I thought it was unlikely, I thought it was worth checking and asked.
"Hmm?"
"Is my father coming? Not someone else, a proxy?"
Chabashira-sensei nodded, seemingly puzzled by my intention.
"Yes, that's what I heard."
"No way--- Didn't he immediately refuse the proposal for a three-way interview?"
While making a face as if she didn't understand well, Chabashira-sensei showed some understanding after a while.
"Indeed, when I first mentioned the three-way interview in an email, I received a reply that he intended to send a proxy due to his busy schedule. In that sense, your statement is correct. But the other day, when I informed him of the specific date for the three-way interview under that premise, the situation seemed to have changed."
She reconfirmed on her tablet, perhaps just to be sure, and continued.
"He called me and said that your father would come in person. I heard it directly from him, so there's no mistake."
"...That's..."
What kind of twist of fate is this? That man doesn't easily retract his previous statements. At least that was the case with us, the White Room students. He said outright that he wouldn't meet me at this school, so why would he bother to attend a three-way interview?
It seems that he initially refused, as I had imagined.
However, he suddenly expressed his intention to come himself?
It's impossible not to think there's a catch.
"What exactly did my father say on the phone?"
"What? We didn't have any deep conversation. He had appointed a proxy, but since he could make time, he would attend the three-way interview. However, if there is even a slight change in the schedule given to him, he wants us to let him know. This is not uncommon for busy parents, is it?"
"That's true."
If you think about it normally, he wouldn't have been able to make time for a three-way interview, but he looked at the set schedule and decided that he could make it, so he contacted the school.

The flow was easy to understand and there was nothing strange.
"But...ah, no, this isn't something to mention."
Chabashira-sensei started to say something but then stopped herself.
"But what?"
Desperate for any hint, I demanded she continue.
"It's not a big deal. But I did think it was a bit odd. Normally, if the schedule changes, it's natural to want to be notified. But that should only apply if there's a change in the parent-teacher conference schedule for their own child. But your father said he wanted to be notified of even the slightest changes to the entire class schedule that I just handed out."
"So even if a classmate's conference is rescheduled to a different day, for example?"
"That's right. I thought it was a bit neurotic, but there's no harm in telling him."
So Chabashira-sensei didn't think much of it and agreed.
But if that man had a purpose in attending the three-way conference, the reason was there.
"Could I see the schedule for the three-way conference, if you don't mind?"
"The schedule? ---Well, sure. There's no problem with showing you that."
She operated her tablet and turned the screen toward me.
"This is the schedule for the three-way conference for the entire class. It's basically the same format as the two-way conference. So Ayanokōji is scheduled last."
March 26th, 28th, 30th, April 1st.
The schedule for the three-way conference to be held over four days.
As Chabashira-sensei said, my name was listed at the end of the day on the 1st, at 5 p.m.
"There's nothing special to see. Is that okay?"
"Yes, thank you."
Chabashira-sensei turned the screen of the tablet she had been showing me back to herself.
"I'm not saying you should be neurotic about parent-child relationships. I don't know the details, but there's no parent who doesn't love their child. He probably couldn't leave it alone."
"That might be true."
There's no point in discussing the thoughts of Chabashira-sensei and that man here, so I answer as such.
But in reality, I can't imagine him showing up at the three-way conference for such a reason.
Did he decide to aim for expulsion himself, unable to leave it to others?
Even if that's the case, he should have already learned from the last time that it's pointless to confront directly.
I don't know yet what purpose he agreed to attend the three-way conference for.
1
After finishing the two-way conference with lingering questions, I returned to the dormitory before it got dark and got on the elevator. I have a dinner plan with Kei from 7 p.m. today.
So, I have to prepare in about an hour.
First, I'll go back to my room and wash my hands---as I plan my detailed schedule in my head and get off the elevator...
"Hey. You're late coming back, Ayanokōji."
A rare figure was waiting, leaning against the door of my room.
It was Hashimoto Masayoshi, a student from Sakayanagi's class, who seemed to have been waiting for a while, lightly tapping his knee.
"Looking at you coming up alone, it seems like it wasn't a date."
He checked that the closing elevator was empty and asked.
"Today was the day of the two-way conference, that's why I was late."
"Oh, I see... I hadn't considered that possibility. I have something to talk about, do you have time?"
He brought up the reason he had been waiting, while reflecting on his own oversight.
"It doesn't seem like a standing conversation."
"Right. It would be helpful if you could consider that."
Then I have no choice but to consider his intention.
"If you don't mind my room, you can come in."
It seems like my dinner preparation time will be cut short, but I can handle it to some extent.
I couldn't find any other reason to refuse, so I decided to invite Hashimoto in.
"Sorry."
"I can listen to your story, but don't expect too much hospitality."
"That's more than enough for me right now."

He chuckled self-deprecatingly and lightly tapped my back as I inserted the key into the cylinder. 
When I opened the door, I glanced momentarily at the emergency stairs. 
I had a feeling that someone was watching us, but it was hard to tell if Hashimoto was aware of it or not. For now, I didn't worry about it and went inside. 
"Excuse me... Oh, a room of a guy with a girlfriend is indeed different."
As soon as he stepped into the room, he whistled at the traces of Kei scattered around. 
"Can I sit on the bed? Or, would that be inappropriate?"
"Inappropriate? You can do as you like."
With that, Hashimoto, while excusing himself, slowly sat down on the bed. 
Hashimoto seemed to hesitate to sit on someone else's bed. He was considerate. 
"So? What's the matter?"
"It's a pretty heavy story. I'm struggling with how to handle my situation. I want you to listen to my concerns."
He seemed to get straight to the point without beating around the bush, but I felt a snag early on. 
However, it would be rude to interrupt him right from the start, so I decided to let him continue. 
"What do you mean by 'how to handle your situation'?"
"Haven't you heard already? What's the reason for Kamuro-chan's expulsion?"
"I've heard some rumors. Someone leaked information to Ryūen during the special exam. As a result, Class A sank to the bottom."
"Exactly. If the information leaks, there's no chance of winning."
As Hashimoto said, the betrayal caused by the information leak was the decisive factor in the defeat. 
If there had been no leaker, Class A would have had a high chance of avoiding the bottom. 
"I was the first one to be suspected. Now, every day, various people in the class look at me with suspicion."
In fact, it wasn't just within the class. 
The act of betraying one's own class was so shocking and threatening that it was not limited to the class. 
"To be honest, I've heard such voices too. I sympathize with your current situation."
So far, the loudest voice was that Hashimoto was the one who betrayed. 
There were suspicions that he had been in contact with Ryūen and made a secret agreement. 
Considering his past suspicious behavior, it was a natural flow. 
However, I hadn't heard any talk of concrete evidence. 
At present, it was being suggested by process of elimination that it might be Hashimoto. 
"Do I have no choice but to accept this? Because of my daily behavior."
"If you don't want to put up with it, you can act and claim your innocence."
"I wonder. They say 'innocent until proven guilty', but I think the world is the opposite. If you raise your voice in a suspicious situation, the suspicion will only deepen. People who have decided in their heads that you are the culprit without any evidence will even doubt your cry of grief."
That's exactly what they call the echo chamber phenomenon. Students with similar opinions gather and misunderstand that they are correct. This tendency is particularly likely to increase in this closed school. 
The troublesome thing is that unless Hashimoto himself can produce decisive evidence that he is not the culprit, there is nothing he can do about this phenomenon. 
"Maybe you're right. Choosing to remain silent."
"Right?"
Unless you have clear evidence to the contrary, opening your mouth won't change the situation. 
Rather, a careless remark might only increase suspicion. 
"It's heartbreaking."
As he pretended to press his eyes, I spoke up. 
"Isn't that enough for a preface? What's the reason Hashimoto betrayed Sakayanagi?"
At those words, Hashimoto's movements stopped abruptly, and his fingers slowly moved away from his eyes. 
"Hey, let me build up a little. It makes me look stupid for acting like a poor me."
"I thought it was a waste of time. It's already late, and I'd like to prepare dinner as soon as possible."
I told him that, keeping it a secret that Kei would be coming to my room later. 
"Really? Do you have a date with your girlfriend or something?"
"Something like that."
"What do you mean, 'something like that'? Our friendship should be stronger than a woman."
"Sorry, but it's impossible to change the order of appointments. Besides, I don't remember our friendship being that strong."

Hashimoto placed both hands on the bed and took a breath.
"Well, if you understand the situation calmly, that's fine. It's more convenient now."
After a pause, he immediately touched on the core part.
"Why do you think I betrayed Sakayanagi?"
Hashimoto posed a question before hearing the answer.
"I don't know that much. The only thing I can think of is receiving a large amount of private points."
He voiced the story that the public would imagine.
However, he was skeptical whether that was enough to be considered a betrayal.
Indeed, he had dirtied Sakayanagi, but only once. Moreover, the lost class points were 100.
Although it was significant that Kamuro, a close position, had retired, it was only a by-product, and the possibility of being included in the negotiation stage and reward was low.
500,000 or 1 million. Even if it's more, it's too cheap as a price for betraying the class.
"What I want to hear is not an answer that anyone can think of, but Ayanokōji's opinion."
Hashimoto seemed to know very well that I wasn't answering seriously.
"Sorry, but I can't feel like expressing my opinion."
"Huh? Why? Because there's no relationship between you and me?"
"No, it's because you're not serious about the conversation."
"Huh? I'm seriously consulting. I'm desperately looking for a way to survive."
"If you're really saying that, it's too late."
"Too late..."
"A person who is lost and can't decide how to behave himself will not betray the class from the beginning."
Pulling a bow to Sakayanagi is equivalent to aiming for the general's neck.
It's not something you decide based on the atmosphere of the place, but after deciding all the subsequent responses.
"I see, I see. Indeed, it's a foolish remark to consult about how to behave..."
That was the catch I felt as soon as the discussion started.
Hashimoto repeatedly apologized for his mistake, and then started the conversation again.
"The reason I betrayed Sakayanagi was because of your existence, Ayanokōji. The trigger was trying to persuade Sakayanagi to pull you into Class A no matter what."
"Persuade? It's hardly persuasive. It's just a self-harming act involving the class."
"Interesting expression. Well, it's mostly correct."
Hashimoto answered with a laugh, but I couldn't tell if he was relaxed or not.
I felt a behavior that deliberately hid so as not to be aware of his feelings.
He probably doesn't want to show his weakness to me.
While telling a story that contains the truth, there is still a section that hides many secrets inside.
"I only have more questions. Betray Sakayanagi after weighing me? If other students hear it, don't you think it's a story that makes them hold their heads because they can't understand?"
"Those who hold their heads are incompetent. There's no need for modesty in this situation. I'm convinced that you're the most amazing one, moving more than anyone else and gathering information. I can explain from the beginning if necessary, but it will waste the time you're saving."
"Even if you deny it, you don't seem to be convinced."
"I won't. You have the ability to turn the class ranking upside down by yourself. That's why I threatened to betray Sakayanagi next time if she didn't catch you. If she had listened to me, Ayanokōji would have come to Class A and it would have been solid. The completion of the equation of victory."
Hashimoto clenched his fist tightly, but it was too reckless and unrealistic.
"I'm sorry to say, but it's too much of a fantasy. Even if I had the ability that Hashimoto imagines, it would be meaningless if I made Sakayanagi an enemy. Besides, when I was invited before, I certainly said that I would consider it positively, but I don't remember saying that I would officially go."
Without even securing a guarantee, he acted on his own, clearly running too far ahead.
"So, even if you realize the transfer, you won't come to Class A?"
"I can only say that's the case right now. I'm not interested in confronting Sakayanagi."
When I conveyed what I naturally thought, Hashimoto was shocked, but muttered, 'I guess that's the way it is.'
"The best answer was yes, but well, I guess it's not that easy."
From the fact that he answered so calmly, he must have fully considered the possibility that I would not choose Class A.
Then, what was this betrayal for?
It is difficult to clearly infer from the information currently available.
"Hey, do I look like I'm going to betray? I was the first to be suspected by Sakayanagi."
"That's your character."

"Defend me a little... just kidding. Even though I was the one who started it, I was declared war on. There's no way I could win if you think about it normally"
 Sakayanagi, regretting having abandoned Kamuro, probably has stronger feelings towards the traitor who caused it than the person himself thinks.
"But, is this betrayal all my fault? I intended to teach the best method I could think of to graduate in class A. I only took drastic measures because they didn't listen. Where did I go wrong?"
"That's stubbornness. However--- your intuition isn't wrong. Certainly, there's no guarantee that we can stay in class A just by continuing to follow orders under Sakayanagi with the current forces"
 The difference in class points is gradually narrowing in reality.
"Right"
"But you've also made a big mistake at the same time"
"Is it turning Sakayanagi into an enemy?"
"It's correct but incorrect. It's not wrong to turn Sakayanagi into an enemy. What was wrong was acting without any guarantee of winning even after turning Sakayanagi into an enemy. If the chances of winning were slim, you should have taken a different approach"
"I thought about it in my own way. But I concluded that this was the only way"
"It's the answer you calculated and derived. It can't be said for sure that it's the right answer"
 Hashimoto didn't deny that and imagined what would happen next.
"There's no turning back, huh? If that's the case, do you think I'll be eaten by Sakayanagi as it is?"
"That's likely. If you don't like it, the only option left is to defeat Sakayanagi"
"Do you think I can fight and win against Sakayanagi?"
"Just to confirm, by defeating Sakayanagi, you mean expelling her, right?"
 Hashimoto nodded. In other words, there's no way to reconcile. If so, the answer is one.
"Even if you look at it favorably, the odds are too bad. It's hard to say because it depends on the upcoming special exams, but Sakayanagi probably wants to expel you more than Ryūen in a way. In extreme terms, even if you retaliate and push Sakayanagi to expulsion, you might be taken down with her"
 If that happens, Ryūen can avoid accepting the troublesome existence of the traitor Hashimoto and at the same time can get rid of a strong enemy, so it's like killing two birds with one stone for Ryūen.
 No, even if you're prepared to die together, it's difficult to defeat Sakayanagi.
 There is an overwhelming difference in power between Sakayanagi and Hashimoto, as far as we can judge at this point.
 The opponent is one or two steps ahead of Hashimoto and even has Protection Points.
 In other words, you have to stab twice to defeat her.
 And now, Hashimoto is only thinking about fighting Sakayanagi.
 But that's naive.
 I understand the feeling of wanting to believe that the problem will be solved all at once when the game is over.
 However, even if you can defeat Sakayanagi, it's just the beginning.
 Rebuilding a collapsing class. Those who come for revenge. Problems will keep overflowing.
 I betrayed Sakayanagi without any assurance that I would become an ally, knowing that I would be at a disadvantage.
 What else can you call this strange behavior?
"The flaw in Hashimoto that I saw in this discussion is that he doesn't trust people"
 He doesn't tell everything, and he makes decisions and acts on his own.
 It's fine when you're successful, but when you're likely to fail, you don't have anyone to rely on.
"I won't deny it. But it's the same with Ryūen and Sakayanagi. They don't trust others"
"They have the power to fight without trusting others"
"That's where the conversation comes back to"
 Hashimoto is not incapable of foreseeing the future.
 He felt in his skin that he would eventually lose in a state of making me an enemy.
 That's not bad. However, he has been and will continue to think and conclude on his own. The harm caused by not being able to trust others.
 If Hashimoto had several people he could trust from the bottom of his heart, the current situation might have been a little better.
"I don't want you to think that I rebelled against Sakayanagi without any chance of winning. I'm not that foolish"
 Hashimoto muttered that he had his own chances of winning.
 I was willing to listen and leaned my ear, but he didn't try to >>>talk<<< about the rest, just looking at me.
"---Before I let you hear what's next, there's something I really want to confirm with Ayanokōji"
 Then, Hashimoto threw a question at me.
 Why did he betray Sakayanagi at that timing and take a big gamble?
 A question to start talking about that.
 2

The discussion with Hashimoto seemed to have taken longer than expected.
"Sorry. Karuizawa is coming next, right? I made you listen to my long story."
"It couldn't be helped. It wasn't a topic to cut short."
"Can I interpret it as a meaningful time?"
When I nodded affirmatively, Hashimoto also nodded back in response.
His face, which had been showing ups and downs, seemed a bit brighter.
It looked like he had vented what he had been holding in.
I decided to go outside while seeing off Hashimoto.
"I'll buy dinner at the convenience store today."
When I told Hashimoto, who was about to press the elevator call button, he stopped his finger before touching the button for the upper floor and immediately pressed the button for the lower floor.
"Can I join you then? Of course, no more heavy talks, okay?"
Naturally, Hashimoto also looked quite exhausted.
Understanding his desire to get things done easily, I decided to go to the convenience store with him.
We got on the elevator and went down to the lobby.
Then, we ran into Hashimoto's classmate Morishita, who seemed to have just returned home.
"What a coincidence, Ayanokōji Kiyotaka."
"It's a coincidence, isn't it?"
It was a moment to feel the change in human relationships.
There were many cases where I had passed by Morishita during my two years of school life.
Even though I didn't care where or when we passed each other, now when we meet face to face, we both stop and naturally start a conversation.
"And what a coincidence to see the traitor Hashimoto Masayoshi too."
"Hey, hey, what a way to greet me. Give me a break."
"I'm sorry. I haven't found any evidence to confirm it yet. I humbly correct myself."
Even if his statement was corrected, the fact that he was thought of in that way couldn't be changed.
He was indeed a traitor, but Hashimoto must have thought it was good in a way that I was sitting with him.
"Ayanokōji Kiyotaka, you're not surprised, are you?"
"It's been rumored for a long time now. Besides, unlike the parties in Class A, I'm not particularly interested in the truth."
"Is that so? I thought you were consulting with the traitor."
He bluntly says what he thinks and suspects, and ruthlessly attacks us.
As I was admiring his courage, Hashimoto intervened.
"Stop it. It's okay to suspect me as a traitor, but it's better not to involve outsiders when Princess hasn't given any instructions."
With a confident tone that didn't seem like a traitor, he stopped Morishita.
"You might be right. But it's almost night. Where are you going?"
Morishita, who didn't try to force Hashimoto any further, threw the question at me.
"I'm going to the convenience store now. I'm going to buy dinner."
"Me too."
"I didn't ask Hashimoto Masayoshi, I see. But I thought Ayanokōji Kiyotaka was basically a person who cooks for himself---Did you get late because you were talking with someone?"
Recently, I have been cooking for myself a lot, but I wonder where he got that information.
Morishita's suspicion seemed to be growing stronger, and he deliberately voiced his doubts.
"I just happened to be in the elevator with Ayanokōji. It seems he got late because of his two-person meeting."
Perhaps thinking it would be troublesome to be asked such a thing, Hashimoto lightly brushed it off.
However, Morishita seemed to have deepened his suspicion even more.
"That's strange. Ayanokōji Kiyotaka's two-person meeting should have ended a long time ago. It seems you two have been talking a lot today."
Whether he had been investigating the internal affairs of the Horikita class, he had a good grasp of things that even Hashimoto didn't know.
The attempt to casually brush it off seemed to have backfired.
"No, I told you I have nothing to do with it. I have no idea what Ayanokōji was doing."
"But you two seemed to be together from the time you got on the elevator on the fourth floor, didn't you?"
He said so, blocking the escape route, and lightly turned his gaze to the elevator monitor.

"Tch, I've been seen..."
"Maybe it wouldn't bother you so much if it was someone else, but it's unfortunate that you were seen by the wrong person."
Hashimoto grimaced in a defeated manner.
However, he didn't seem flustered or panicked by this unexpected encounter.
"Is it about your role as a traitor?"
"Huh? What do you mean, traitor?"
"It means a betrayer."
When I explained the meaning, Hashimoto dramatically dropped his shoulders as if he was taken aback.
"Give me a break, Morishita. It's a completely different matter."
"What kind of different matter?"
"I can't say. There are things that can only be discussed between guys, right?"
Since he was seeking agreement, I decided to go along with it.
"If it's about gender differences, I can't pursue it further. It's an easy way to escape from questioning."
"No matter what I say, it's no good."
Hashimoto shrugged his shoulders in surrender.
Just as we were talking a moment ago, the more he opened his mouth, the more he was suspected.
"Well, that's fine. Can I accompany you to the convenience store?"
"Well, I don't mind, but do you have something to do?"
"Yes. I'm sure I'll think of something once I get there."
He was revealing that he had no particular business, but I had no right to refuse him.
Even if I refused, there would be nothing I could do if he followed me from behind.
"Alright. Well, let's go together, the three of us."
"Then I'll follow you."
Morishita, who had turned around, took the lead and started walking.
"Why are you taking the lead... You're always a strange guy. Sorry, Ayanokōji."
"It's fine. It's not a big deal."
What I suddenly thought was, how is Morishita perceived in Class A?
His academic excellence must be a well-known fact from the OAA.
But I honestly don't know anything else. It might be a good idea to ask.
"What kind of student is Morishita in class?"
"He's just as you see him. He's smart but eccentric, and he always acts alone."
"Doesn't he have any close friends?"
"I don't remember any."
Given his relentless pursuit of information, his statements seem credible.
Watching Morishita's back, Hashimoto touched his chin with his index finger and thumb, looking puzzled.
"That's why it's unusual. It's rare for him to start a conversation like this."
After murmuring that, he glanced at me, so I took the initiative.
"Isn't he just monitoring the traitor?"
"Well... that's not impossible... but you're not holding back either, are you?"
"If I need to be considerate, I'll be considerate."
"Damn. What I'm curious about is that, to my understanding, Morishita is not an extreme Sakayanagi believer. He's kind of aloof. But he's not the type to take the initiative and solve problems on his own. In other words, I can't see a reason for him to probe."
Morishita isn't the type to take the initiative? Is that really the case?
Although our interactions have been limited, my impression is the opposite. I have a stronger impression of him as someone who actively works alone to solve problems.
Of course, it's possible that Morishita changed his mind after losing to Sakayanagi, who had been steadily defending herself until now. However, it's hard to believe that Hashimoto is completely unaware of this sign.
This guy mixes truth and lies in a similar ratio, talking without showing any signs.
Even the situation of the three of us walking together now may not have been born out of mere coincidence.
Hashimoto may want to make Sakayanagi realize that he has made contact with me, indirectly and seemingly by chance.
It might be safe to assume that he has such a motive.

If he didn't want to be noticed, he wouldn't have waited in front of my room, which could attract attention. We both knew each other's contact information, so we could communicate secretly as much as we wanted. The purpose was to let Sakayanagi notice, directly or indirectly, the fact that Hashimoto, a traitor, had contacted me.

Of course, only Hashimoto knew the truth at that time, but there were also things that I could understand.

The truth and lies Hashimoto showed in my room.

He believed that all his actions would lead to his own benefit.

He wanted to be the only one to benefit.

He wanted to be the only one to survive.

He wanted to be the only one to win---

He didn't care what happened to others in the process, that's what he thought.

If a pacifist knew, Hashimoto's existence would probably be despised as evil.

The more I knew about Hashimoto, the more I sympathized with him and agreed with him.

Because he was living to the core.

Originally, it takes undeniable power to stick to such evil.

But Hashimoto didn't have that power.

So he learned to change his color to match the environment like a chameleon.

He tried to blend into the environment and survive.

That was exactly what he was doing at that moment and what he had been doing so far.

We left the lobby and walked to the convenience store with three people.

Then I entered the store, picked up a basket, and contacted Kei on my cell phone.

I asked her what she wanted and decided on dinner with my portion.

The side dishes at the convenience store that you just heat up are delicious enough.

While shopping, I ran into someone who had come in after us in the beverage corner.

"Ah... Go, Good evening..."

The one who greeted me was Yamamura Miki, a girl in the same class as Hashimoto.

"I didn't expect to meet you here."

"Yes, that's right."

Yamamura, who seemed somewhat uncomfortable, agreed with my words.

It seemed that Yamamura was the one who had been watching Hashimoto on the emergency stairs after all.

I hardly noticed her presence after leaving the dormitory and didn't know who it was.

That's why I thought it might be Yamamura, and it seems I was right.

I don't know yet whether she's acting alone or if Sakayanagi is hiding behind her, but from the fact that she was standing by before I returned to my room by elevator, it's more likely that she was watching Hashimoto.

Rather, there's no particular reason for Yamamura to secretly watch me at the moment.

"Oh, it's Yamamura. What a coincidence."

Hashimoto, who noticed us talking, came over with a curry-flavored cup noodle in his hand.

"Good evening... Hashimoto-kun."

"I've never seen Yamamura use a convenience store before."

Whether it's just a habit or he's sniffing something out.

He speaks information that he doesn't know whether it's true or false, watching Yamamura's reaction.

"Um, I, I use the convenience store quite a bit... about once or twice a week... because I don't stand out... I'm sorry."

"Oh, no, I'm sorry..."

He must have been trying to probe, but because he pointed out Yamamura's lack of presence, Hashimoto hurriedly apologized.

"It's rare. Yamamura Miki talking to boys."

"You're the one to talk, Morishita."

"I'm just a little curious about Hashimoto Masayoshi, the traitor... I mean. Is it love?"

"Don't deliberately throw that in periodically... Well, Yamamura probably suspects me too."

Right? Yamamura looked down and avoided eye contact with such probing gaze.

The heavy silence didn't match the convenience store's characteristics and light music, creating a discord.

It was not Hashimoto or Yamamura who stopped it, but Morishita.

"Since we're here, let's shop together. You don't mind, do you?"

"Eh, ah, yes... If it's okay with me..."
It seemed that her inability to read the atmosphere from the beginning worked in her favor here.
Without asking, Yamamura ended up shopping as well.
Well, after all, a convenience store is a place to shop, so it's not a strange story.
I don't often see Yamamura talking to other students, but she seems to struggle even when talking to her classmates.
She was pulled by the sleeve by Morishita, and forced to pick up recommended products.
And without being able to refuse any of them, she put three or four items in the basket.
"You shouldn't push too hard."
"Why? Yamamura Miki is happily accepting my sales pitch."
"I don't think she's happy at all. She looks troubled to me."
"Is that so?"
"Eh, um..."
Perhaps not knowing how to respond to either side, Yamamura stuttered.
"Am I forcing her to buy?"
"No, that's not what I..."
With just a little pressure from the words, Yamamura retreated, and her voice of denial was swallowed up.
"Is this what you call reluctance? Now, let's move on to the next recommendation. It's a secret from everyone else."
Even though she wasn't a convenience store promoter, she was trying to make her buy the next product.
She tried to take out a juice from the reach-in.
"Sorry to interrupt your friendly chat, but could you move a little?"
While they were having such an exchange, a new customer stopped by the beverage corner.
He seemed to have noticed me, but Yamamura, who was nearby, overlooked him, and their shoulders slightly bumped.
"Ah, I'm sorry."
The convenience store is not very spacious, so just a few people gathering can get in the way of other customers choosing products.
It wasn't a big shock, but Yamamura apologized and gave way.
"No, I'm the one who overlooked. Sorry."
With her long silver hair fluttering, she took out a bottle of green tea.
"I like this brand of tea. It has a rich flavor and aroma like it's brewed in a teapot, don't you think? Ayanokōji."
The one who looked at me and spoke like a beverage promoter was Kiryūin Fūka from class 3B.
"I've never had that brand, so I can't answer."
"That's a shame. You should try it if you have a chance."
"Are you going home now? Kiryūinsenpai."
"Yes. It's getting a bit late. I thought I'd just stop by the convenience store today. This girl here---your new girlfriend?"
"No, it's not."
"Ah, um... I'm Yamamura..."
"I'm Morishita Ai."
"Yamamura and Morishita. Are you in the same class as Ayanokōji?"
"No, they are in class A."
"Oh? It's good to have a wide range of social relationships. You should cherish your friends."
"Do you say that, Kiryūinsenpai?"
It's an uncharacteristic line for someone who stands out among the third graders for her aloofness.
"Nice to meet you, Kiryūinsenpai. My name is Hashimoto, also from class A."
Hashimoto, who had been looking at Yamamura, interrupted Kiryūin and greeted her while extending his hand.
Kiryūin nodded, brushing off his hand.
"I'll remember all three of you."
After a brief exchange, Kiryūin finished paying first and left the convenience store.
It was a bit surprising that Kiryūin, who didn't seem interested in others, said she would remember the three of them, even if it might have been a formality.
It might not have meant much.

"Were you close with Kiryūinsenpai? He's famous for not hanging out with anyone."
"Not particularly close."
Hashimoto stared at Kiryūin's back as he headed towards the dormitory for a while.
〇Exchange Camp
Thursday morning at 9:30. A flock of buses parked on the ground.
While faintly smelling the exhaust gas from idling, the students boarded with light steps.
For many second-year students, excluding those who go on expeditions for club activities, this was the third outing of the year following the deserted island test and school trip, a camp for all grades.
However, it was announced in advance that it was significantly different from last year's mixed camp, and although it was included in the category of camps in form, its nature was completely different.
Therefore, the name 'special test' was not used.
Before moving, what was of concern was the number of buses prepared for the students.
Usually, one for each class. In other words, if all three grades participate, it would be 12.
However, the number of buses gathered on the ground this time was nine in total.
But the mystery was immediately solved by looking at the students boarding.
There was only one bus prepared for the third graders.
It seemed that the reason was that the number of students gathered was very small, only about 20.
It couldn't be asserted because not all faces were seen, but as far as could be seen, it seemed that five students from each of the four classes A to D were gathered from the third grade.
When receiving instructions and boarding the bus, there was no particular seat designation, and it was explained that you could sit wherever you liked.
Upon hearing that, Kei immediately clung to my arm.
"I'll sit with Kiyotaka."
Despite receiving cold stares from some boys, I gave a consent reply, boarded the bus, and sat down on the window side of the third seat from the back on the right. Kei sat next to me.
"Wouldn't it have been better to stick with the girls?"
"I'll do that on the way back. It's okay to be together on the way there, right?"
We spend most of our private time together, but she also wanted that on the bus.
I didn't know what was different, but she seemed happier than usual.
Everyone boarded, and by the time the preparations for the other buses were finished, Chabashira-sensei boarded.
"It reminds me of last year's camp. We had various exchanges with Kiyotaka at that time too."
"That's right."
A year since then.
At that time, neither of us thought that our relationship with Kei would deepen this much.
Not only Kei, but the relationships with the people around us have also changed significantly.
"Oh yeah. I found out yesterday that my favorite movie is going to be screened. Let's go see it together when it starts."
While narrowing her eyes happily, Kei showed me an image that looked like a movie poster.
For Kei, it was just one of the casual conversations she naturally brought up.
However, there was one thing that bothered me.
"When is the movie scheduled to be screened?"
"Um, when was it? It felt like a spring screening when I saw the special news before."
"I want to know the specific date."
"Huh? Is there something wrong? Let me see... oh, it's listed here."
The homepage that Kei showed me said that the screening would start on March 26.
Fortunately, it's before the start of the new semester, during the school's spring break.
"I see. Let's go see it."
"Yay! It's super interesting, so I think Kiyotaka will enjoy it too."
Kei, who said that with a smile, froze her smile as she looked at my face.
"What's wrong?"
"No, it's nothing."
Answering that, Kei took her eyes off me and started to prepare for the movie by looking at a page that seemed to be a character correlation chart of the movie, humming a tune.
After that, the students each enjoyed the outside scenery while chatting as they liked.
About 20 minutes after the bus left and went through the city, Chabashira-sensei held a microphone and looked at the students from the front to the back.

"Let's go over the details of the training camp. As I briefly mentioned at school, it has been decided that we will hold an experiential learning exchange meeting for all grades over the next three nights and four days."
Normally, this would be a tense moment, but the students boarding the bus showed no signs of tension.
While listening to Chabashira-sensei's words, they were enjoying the scenery outside or resting their bodies, creating a different mood than usual.
As I mentioned earlier, this is not a special test, but a simple exchange meeting.
"Let me reiterate, do not perceive this exchange meeting as a special test. There will be no increase or decrease in class points this time. Unless you engage in disruptive behavior that deviates from student life, there should be no risk of expulsion. You can earn some private points by participating in games, but it's more of a voluntary participation than mandatory."
Chabashira-sensei explained this emphatically, which was to be expected.
The students have become more cautious in their long life at ANHS.
Despite being an exchange meeting, they have developed a habit of suspecting that something is going on behind the scenes.
That's why they are announcing that it's not a special test, that class points won't change, and that there are no penalties like expulsion waiting.
This gives the students some peace of mind.
"It's unfortunate that >>>Ishibashi<<< had to be absent due to poor health, but it's a blessing in disguise."
There are surprisingly many students with poor health, as colds are prevalent at this time of year.
"As some of you may have noticed, although it's for all grades, this time only five representatives from each class of the third grade will participate. This is taking into account various circumstances."
Chabashira-sensei briefly touched on this, but did not elaborate.
"Therefore, your main purpose will be to interact with the first graders, but it's not like you can get along with everyone just by giving vague instructions. As soon as you arrive at the camp, all grades will be divided into 20 groups. The 20 third graders who will be the representatives of each group have already finished organizing the members based on the full list of first and second graders."
This means that the groups are not decided on the spot when they arrive, but have already been decided, they just haven't been informed.
"I will now distribute the organization chart, so remember which group you belong to. There may be some differences in the number of people and the gender ratio, but the balance of grades and classes has been adjusted as much as possible. The games will be played group against group to determine the winner."
Chabashira-sensei handed out the printouts to the students sitting in front of her on both the right and left sides.
The students took the necessary number of printouts and passed them on to the students sitting in the back.
"This printout also lists some small rewards you can get from the games and the conditions for getting them. You should read it at the same time."
"It's not a test, so it's easy, but I still want private points. Whether you get into a good group or not seems to make a big difference in your winning rate, doesn't it?"
"Right."
It's only natural to hope that as many excellent students as possible are in the same group.
Of course, it's still unknown what skills will be required to determine the outcome.
Hondō, who was sitting in front of us, stood up and handed us the remaining printouts. Kei took them and passed them on to the back.
"I hope I'm with Kiyotaka."
The printouts were clipped together in groups of five, detailing the group activities, rewards for the exchange meeting, and a list of student names from the bottom of the third page to the fifth.
I noticed when I flipped it over, but there was also a business card-sized folded card sandwiched in.
Fortunately, the printout was made for this class, so the students in this class are marked for easy identification. This way, it won't be too hard to find my name.
The names of the absentees were also listed, with two second-year students, Ishibashi and Ichinose, and surprisingly many first-year students, including Ishigami.
I think it's a coincidence due to poor health, but I won't have a chance to get involved.
"It seems I'm in the seventh group with Tanaka-senpai. Kiyotaka isn't there... but..."
Kei, who quickly found her name in the middle of the first page, looked disappointed but also somewhat relieved. I wonder why.
"But what?"
"It's a camp, and it seems like I'll be sharing a room with the girls in my group, and there are some people I don't want to be with... I'm glad that person isn't there."
At the beginning of the printout, it was written that in addition to the games, they would be living together in a room separated by gender. That must be why she reacted that way.
She didn't specify who, but there's no doubt she was referring to Ichinose.
In the last special test, she was surprised by the persistent continuous nominations, even though it was a strategy.
"It's not that I don't like Ichinose-san, but I'm a little scared."
She muttered this and glared at me.
"You're close to Ichinose-san, Kiyotaka. I sometimes suspect various things."
Kei whispered this to me in a voice that no one else could hear.
"So that's why you were complicated."
"There's a possibility that you could be with Kiyotaka, right?"
Surprisingly, Ichinose's presence seemed to have grown in a bad way in Kei's mind.
"It seems I'm in the 20th group with Kiryūin-senpai at the end of the fifth page."
I quickly looked through the list of all 20 groups, and as Chabashira-sensei had previously announced, the gender balance was as balanced as possible, and the class distribution was either a maximum of three or a minimum of one, basically two each. It seems to be as equal as possible.
However, I felt an unusual bias and inequality in some parts of each group.

Most of the other students were still looking for their names, so few would have noticed yet, but it was only a matter of time before questions started to arise. Kei, who hadn't noticed anything yet, was still regretfully looking at the list, disappointed that she couldn't be with me. I then focused again on the reward section listed at the top of the first page.

Group Ranking Rewards
1st place: 30,000 private points for each student
2nd place: 20,000 private points for each student
3rd place: 10,000 private points for each student
4th-10th place: 5,000 private points for each student
11th-15th place: 3,000 private points for each student
16th-20th place: 1,000 private points for each student
*Private points obtained at this exchange meeting cannot be transferred
*Use is limited to shopping within Keyaki Mall
*To receive rewards, you must meet the conditions of the point card

When you focus on each student individually, it seems that you can't get a huge reward because it doesn't apply to the special test. And it's not a system where only certain classes benefit. However, for high school students, even 1,000 or 2,000 yen is a significant income, so naturally, they would want to aim for the top. The fact that they can't be transferred and can only be used in certain places is a disadvantage, but on the other hand, it's a merit that they can be used freely without hesitation because they can't be used strategically.

The students continued to stare at the list for a while.
"Um... Chabashira-sensei. May I ask a question?"
Sonoda raised her hand after roughly grasping the groups.
"You had something on your mind?"
"Yes. If each group is going to play a game, is this... fair? I mean, even if it's impossible to be completely fair, it seems a bit unbalanced... like Nagumo-senpai's group, that's how I felt."
"There's no consideration for OAA standard balance. It wouldn't be strange if there was a drastic bias."
In response to the question, Chabashira-sensei gave a casual answer.
"Wow, it's true. Isn't Nagumo-senpai's group quite dangerous?"
While listening to the question and checking the list, Ike, who saw the group led by Nagumo, spoke up.
Nagumo is a well-known former student council president and a student who holds all A's or above in the OAA. However, what's surprising is the stable lineup.
1st year A class: Takahashi Osamu, Tōdō Rin, Amasawa Ichika  B class: Hagiwara Chihaya, Fukuchi Hinano
C class: Namekawa Azuki, Iguchi Yuri  D class: Tatewaki Aoi, Osaki Noa
2nd year A class: Sanada Kousei, Sawada Yasumi  B class: Horikita Suzune, Hirata Yōsuke
C class: Kaneda Satoru, Katsuragi Kōhei  D class: Kanzaki Ryūji
All of them are excellent in studies, have high athletic ability, or can follow instructions accurately, and they have chosen students who can bring the group together without hesitation.
If we talk about individual abilities, there are students with outstanding abilities like Sakayanagi, Ryūen, and Kōenji, but it's unknown what kind of chemical reaction will occur when they are mixed.
Isn't this one of the all-around groups that was formed while avoiding that?
After seeing this, many other groups inevitably fade.
If it's a group where Sakayanagi and Ryūen, who were mentioned earlier, belong, they might be able to throw a stone to win the strongest group, but most of the groups don't apply and defeat is inevitable. If there was a game that only specialized in academic ability, they wouldn't be able to win in overall strength.
"There may be some who think the group assignment is somewhat unfair, but it can't be helped. It's natural law that excellent students are attracted to stable groups."
Chabashira-sensei, holding the printout in one hand, answered with a stern look.
Sonoda, who asked the question, shrank at the sight of her expression.
It's a reasonable argument that can't be refuted once it's said.
Thinking that the threat was too much, the teacher softened her expression and showed a slight smile.
"But just because you're excellent doesn't mean you'll always win. Especially in this case."
Telling Sonoda that there was not no hope, she continued the explanation.
"This exchange meeting will be a round-robin game over three days. Groups will compete against each other, but it will be one group against one group, and the order of the matches is not disclosed. Also, the content of the game is randomly selected from the list each time."
Chabashira-sensei continued to verbally convey the detailed rules, but to summarize the rules of the exchange meeting, it's like this.
Exchange Meeting Experiential Learning Game Overview
Period: Conducted over three days
Day 1: 5 matches Day 2: 7 matches Day 3: 7 matches

※There was a 30-minute interval between each game.
The competition was conducted in a round-robin format with all 20 groups.
The order of the matches was not disclosed.
The rule was that a representative from each group, a third-year student, would select five participants to compete in each game.
Only first and second-year students could be selected to participate in the games.
The principle was one-on-one, and the group that won three times was declared the winner.
Even if a loss was confirmed, all five members would play the game.
There was no limit to the number of times one could participate in the game, one could participate as many times as they wanted.
The content of the game was randomly selected from a list provided by the school and announced as needed.
The victory condition was that the group with the most wins would be awarded.
※If there was a tie for third place or higher, an additional game would be played.
As expected from something called a game, the content seemed to be really light. It was clear at a glance when looking at the list prepared by the school, with unique things like "flower pressing" and "pottery wheel making" that seemed unique to the training camp, as well as game-like things like "cards" and "UNO", and sports like "table tennis". Of course, there were some things that required a bit of thinking and involved academic skills, but they probably weren't important.
There were also things like flower arrangement and bonsai, and looking at it this way, it was a really interesting lineup.
And all the games on this list seemed to be available for experience at any time outside of the matches.
It also seemed possible that the same game could be given two or three times.
With the detailed explanation, it became clear. For three nights and four days, they were supposed to interact with their kōhai, make things, play games, compete for rankings, and deepen their friendship.
It might be boring for students who are not interested, but I'm honestly looking forward to being able to experience making things.
"The point card was included in the printouts distributed on the bus. You can collect stamps when you participate in various experiential learning activities at the training camp. Be careful, as filling this out is a condition for receiving rewards."
It seemed to be an item to encourage voluntary participation in experiential learning.
There were a few rules, such as a limit on the number of stamps you could collect in a day and not being able to receive multiple stamps for the same game, but it didn't seem to be a big deal.
Anyway, I wanted to try various things that I couldn't usually do at school.
With the understanding of the content, even groups with low OAA overall strength could see plenty of opportunities.
With these rules, it seemed safe to say that there was a chance of winning against any group.
"I hope it's clear that there's no need to be too concerned about winning or losing this time. Of course, it's fine to aim for first place and unite for the sake of rewards, but as you can see from the list of various games, the main focus is on interaction using experiential learning. It's perfectly fine to actively interact with other groups and focus on deepening friendships."
So far, we had been given various tasks and their rules from the school, such as special exams.
For the first time, we were given permission to not have to win or lose.
"It really feels relaxed. Even if we're in last place, we'll still get 1,000 yen."
For now, many students, starting with Kei, were relieved by the content.
"That's right. The fact that there's nothing wrong with losing this time is probably a big deal."
The classmates who had received the explanation began to spend their time in a friendly manner.
Some even started singing in high spirits.
"Don't forget to follow the school's schedule, even though you're free to a certain extent."
That was a bit of a downer.
Kei and I checked the schedule written on the printout.

Morning session 9 a.m.~12 p.m.  Afternoon session 2 p.m.~6 p.m.
All times except for the test time were basically free time.
In extreme cases, whether to take a nap without having lunch, or to immerse oneself in making things, was left to the individual's discretion.
If the group leader ordered participation in the game, it was not the case, but it seemed that there were no penalties prepared for refusal.
On the first day, it was announced that it would be around noon when they arrived, and from there, they would gather by group, have lunch, and then only the afternoon exchange meeting was scheduled.
"I hope you will behave in a way that is not embarrassing as a senpai at the training camp."
With that, the explanation seemed to be over, and Chabashira-sensei turned off the microphone and sat down.

After the bus had been on the highway for about two hours, the view from the window was completely deep in the mountains. 
The bus stopped in front of a different facility than last year, and the students began to get off. 
The area in front of the main entrance where the buses were lined up was much more open than I had imagined. 
The building where we would be staying for the camp was built like an old inn with a history. 
According to the explanation from the school, it was originally a lodging facility and experience place built during the bubble era. 
Inside, there were classrooms for each experience facility. 
That's probably why there were so many experiential games listed in the previous list. 
"Gather in the assigned groups. From then on, for the next three days, follow the leader's instructions and discuss and get along with everyone."
The 20 third-year students who were assigned as leaders for each group spread out. 
At the end of my gaze, Kiryūin was standing with his hands in the pockets of his jersey jacket. 
"Well, see you later, Kiyotaka."
I watched Kei, who was reluctant to leave, for a moment, and then headed down to Kiryūin. 
"I look forward to working with you for the next three days, Kiryūin-senpai."
"I'm counting on you."
The 1st and 2nd year members assigned to Kiryūin's group, Group 20, were as follows, totaling 16 people. 
1st year A class Toyohashi Goro, >>>Kozumi<<< Dan B class Yanagi Yasuhisa, >>>Eikura Mami<<<
    C class Tsubaki Sakurako, >>>Shintoku<<< Taro D class >>>Kobayashi<<< Yukiki, Jute >>>Misora<<<
2nd year A class Hashimoto Masayoshi, Yamamura Miki, Morishita Ai B class Ayanokōji Kiyotaka, Nishimura Ryuko
    C class Oda Takumi, Shiina Hiyori D class >>>Hatsukawa<<< Maizuru
Kiryūin, the leader, is added to this. 
The impression is that there are students who can do sports and students who can study. 
It's a balance that would be difficult to achieve in an equal competition, but that's probably unique to a relaxed exchange meeting centered on games. 
Of course, among the second-year students, there are many students who usually interact with each other, but among the first-year students, I hardly know anyone other than Tsubaki. In that sense, there must be a great significance in holding an exchange meeting. 
"Hey. I never thought I'd be teaming up with you in this way."
As the group gathered, Hashimoto approached me in a friendly manner at an early stage. 
"I agree."
Just the other day, I had a lot of discussions with Hashimoto and the others, but it's strange that the four of us from that day are in the same group. 
"I'm happy and sad. I wish we could have been together in a dangerous special exam."
He seems to have high expectations for me. I haven't said a word about whether I can meet those expectations yet, but let's leave it at that. 
"Even if it's just an exchange meeting, I'm grateful to receive a decent amount of money if I can get to the top. At least exchanging contact information with the first year is a must. I'll invite you to join the group later."
Even without asking, it's a great help to have someone who is willing to take on the time-consuming role of coordinator. 
"I might delete Hashimoto's name from the registration next month, though."
"Hey, hey, stop with the unfunny jokes like Morishita."
I know I said it, but it might have been a bit like Morishita. 
I wonder if that strange existence is influencing me in unexpected ways. As I was thinking about that, a soft voice reached my ear. 
"Good morning, Ayanokōji-kun."
Hiyori, who had slowly walked up to the group, called my name. 
"Good morning. I'm counting on you from today. It's reassuring to have Hiyori here."
"I feel the same way. I was relieved to know that Ayanokōji-kun is in the same group."
I feel like Hiyori would be accepted by anyone right away, unlike me, but the world that person sees is completely different from what others see. 
I'm genuinely happy to have a reliable friend join me. 
"Hashimoto-kun, I look forward to working with you as well."
Hiyori, who was standing next to me, said that and bowed her head slightly. 
"I always welcome cute girls. But you know, Ayanokōji and Shiina-chan look good together when they stand side by side."
"What do you mean?"
"I don't want you to take it the wrong way, but I think you two look more natural together than Karuizawa."
Is it because we have things in common, like reading, that are different from Kei?

But there was no need to take everything Hashimoto said seriously.
The person who said that had already shifted his interest away from there and started to focus on the entire group that had gathered.
Kiryūin was ignoring the group and staring at the winter mountains.
So he must have thought he had to move.
"Um, is that everyone? Ah, no, are we one short? 1, 2, 3---"
Hashimoto quickly counted the number of people.
"15, and 16 including me. Looks like we're still one short."
One short? I thought everyone was here, was I mistaken?
"There are 17 of us here. Yamamura Miki is also here."
"Oh, really, everyone was here... sorry Yamamura."
Hashimoto hastily corrected himself, seeming to have genuinely overlooked her.
"No... I'm sorry."
For some reason, Yamamura apologized, even though she was just forgotten in the count.
Being unnoticed by Kiryūin and overlooked by her classmate Hashimoto, her inconspicuousness seemed to be as usual, but recently it seemed to be even more pronounced.
However, once her presence was recognized, a strange reversal phenomenon occurred where I felt her presence more because I couldn't sense her as much as others. This might be only applicable to me.
When I asked Hiyori about Yamamura, she said she had never had a proper conversation with her before, so I decided to speak to her, introducing Hiyori in the process.
"We seem to be crossing paths a lot lately."
"Yes, that's true. I look forward to... this time as well."
"Nice to meet you, Yamamura-san."
When Hiyori gave her a gentle, enveloping smile, Yamamura stiffened.
"Ah, yes. You're Shiina-san, right...?"
Yamamura greeted Hiyori hesitantly, but she seemed restless, as if she had something on her mind.
"Oh? Do you have something you want to ask me?"
"Ah---that... you're completely different from what I thought..."
"Me?"
When Hiyori tilted her head in wonder, Yamamura muttered in a low voice.
"I thought you were more... indifferent..."
From Yamamura's distant observation, Hiyori seemed to be that way.
Indeed, I had the same impression of her before. It was through talking and getting to know her that I realized the difference between the image and the reality.
"I'm sorry, I'm not good at talking, so I might have said something rude..."
"It's totally fine. I'm not good at talking to people either, so we're comrades."
"Is that... so?"
Even as she answered, Yamamura didn't seem to see it that way, her eyes said so.
"You don't see it? If so, I think it's thanks to Ayanokōji-kun."
"Ayanokōji-kun's...?"
Mine?
Probably, the same question that Yamamura had was floating in my head.
"Yes. Even though I'm not good at it, I've come to love talking with my friends. So I think Yamamura-san will surely come to love talking too."
Hiyori took Yamamura's hand, who was on guard, and told her again.
Hiyori's statement that it was thanks to me was an exaggeration, but I hope that Yamamura will feel the same way someday.
Anyway, with this, all the members of the Kiryūin group were gathered here.
"AyanokōjiKiyotaka. Nice to meet you."
There it was, Morishita, who called me by my full name without honorifics but in polite language.
"Nice to meet you too."
"You are---um... Shiina Hiyori, right? I'm Morishita Ai. Nice to meet you, nice to meet you."
She bowed her head slightly.
"I'm Shiina. Nice to meet you, Morishita-san."
Starting with Yamamura, the second-year students exchanged light greetings. Then they started to greet the first-year students, who were gathered in one place looking nervous.

Kiryūin, who had been waiting without intervening in the ongoing conversation, turned around.
"Now that the greetings are over, let's have lunch. So, let's disband for now."
"Wait a minute, Kiryūinsenpai. Wouldn't it be better for us to have lunch together to strengthen the camaraderie of the group?"
Hashimoto quickly stepped in to counter Kiryūin's immediate declaration of disbandment.
Indeed, in this situation, that choice wasn't a bad one.
In fact, looking around, it seemed that most groups were starting to act on their own.
"Then I'll leave it to you."
Kiryūin accepted Hashimoto's proposal, but at the same time indicated that he would not be joining them.
Then he left the group and disappeared into the building alone.
"Man, seriously? We've got quite a leader here."
Hashimoto sighed in exasperation at the situation where the leader had gone absent.
"We can ignore him. I agree with having lunch as a group."
It was too much to leave all the decisions to Hashimoto alone, so I lightly backed him up.
"That's right. He said he'd leave it to us, so there's little reason to disband here."
Hashimoto decided that it was detrimental to think too long about the situation, which was confusing the first-year students, and started to act quickly. Even if there were students among the first-years who were reluctant to have a meal with their senpai, it was unlikely that they would object unless they were as quirky as Hōsen, who was holding a mixer.
"Wait a minute, hey! Kōenji!"
Behind Hashimoto, who was explaining to the first-year students, there was a slight problem in another group nearby. It seemed that Kōenji, who had been assigned to the 6th group, had left the scene without following the leader's instructions.
The other second-year students, who were used to seeing the bewildered first-year students in the same group, didn't say anything, even though they found it somewhat nostalgic. Even Inogashira, a classmate, seemed anxious, but in the end, he seemed to have no choice but to let it go.
For a moment, Inogashira and I made eye contact, but he quickly turned back to the angry leader's voice.
"I wonder what happened to Kōenji-kun."
Hiyori, who apparently didn't understand, muttered as she watched Kōenji's retreating back.
"He's always acting alone. He probably won't come back."
"Is that so?"
"Kōenji Rokusuke is a person who can't work in a group. It's something we knew. My condolences."
It seemed that Morishita knew exactly what was going on.
He clasped his hands together as if praying for the 6th group, which was already being attacked by a lack of coordination.
"If AyanokōjiKiyotaka had been in the same group, would you have stopped him as a fellow classmate?"
"Because we're in the same class, I would have been sure it was useless to stop him and would have overlooked it."
Whether or not we're in the same group isn't important. If someone had called out to him and he had stopped and listened, it wouldn't have been a problem.
"Alright. All the first-years have agreed. Let's go too."
Hashimoto gave the order, and we, the 20th group, started walking without our leader.
As we entered the building with our shoes on, a slightly damp smell hit our noses. It might not be a place that is used much now. The students walked in a line, heading to the cafeteria.
Since the leader was absent, it seemed inevitable that Hashimoto, who could take the initiative, would bear the burden.
While having a lively lunch as a group, Hashimoto took the lead and became the center of the conversation.
He encouraged the first-year students who were still reserved and the students who didn't talk much, and spread the conversation widely without making a fuss.
Honestly, for a student like me who often listens, he was a lifesaver.
"Um... Hashimotosenpai. It's written in the rules of this exchange meeting, but we don't need all the members of the group to be present for the game, right?"
"Yeah. The number of people participating in one game is up to five, and the same person can participate as many times as they want. It seems pretty loose."
All we need is the required number of people plus the leader to be present at the designated time.
"Looking at Kiryūinsenpai, it seems like he's not interested in the exchange meeting, so we can just do whatever we want... but I wish he had at least told us his policy."
Since the appointment right is with the leader, the plan is for Kiryūin to decide as soon as the game content is decided.
Hashimoto seemed to be bothered by the fact that Kiryūin hadn't asked anyone about what they were good at or anything.
"For now, all we can do is do what we can do seriously."
"Kiryūinsenpai is amazing, isn't he? Maybe he already knows about us?"
A female student from the first-year D class, Tote, asked Hashimoto.
Even without direct contact, it wouldn't be surprising to know about Kiryūin's high specs.
"There's no way. There's no way he could know who in this group is good at flower arranging."
Hashimoto was incredulous, and rightly so. No one should know each individual's strengths and weaknesses at this point.

"There was a reason why I suggested we all eat together. Let's rate our confidence in the game content written on the printout on a scale of one to five. One means no confidence."
 It was simple, but it was an inevitable action that the leader should take the initiative to do.
 Everyone used their mobile phones to rate their own game content.
 However, the difficult part was that there were many unusual things.
 If it's something you've never experienced before, you can only give it a basic one, and even if you feel like you can do it, you can only give it a maximum of two.
 Moreover, many of these things don't even have a place to practice in advance.
 Things that require artistry on the spot are particularly difficult.
 Everyone operated their mobile phones while eating.
 There was a considerable amount, so some people finished eating by the time it was completed.
 Anyway, this way we could gather data for everyone as a guide.
 And it was immediately shared in the group chat that Hashimoto created.
"...This isn't going to work."
 Hashimoto's first words after looking through it were harsh.
 As feared, almost all of the students gave a rating of one to two to most of the games, and there were hardly any ratings of four or above. Hashimoto seemed to have given up on the chance of winning.
"Maybe we should just give up on the exchange meeting and just play around."
 But it's too early to make that judgment.
 This phenomenon is undoubtedly happening in other groups as well.
"I feel like there are fewer groups that are serious about it... Well, for now, I'll show this information to Kiryūinsenpai and let him decide the policy."
 In the end, that's what it all comes down to for this exchange meeting.
 If Kiryūin is motivated, the kōhai will just follow him.
 If he's not motivated, he'll just participate casually and relax at the training camp.
 Personally, I'd like to take it easy.
 〇
 After finishing lunch, I got up from my seat after looking at a message from a certain person on my mobile phone.
 It was just before one in the afternoon. There was about an hour left until the first game of the day.
"Sorry, but let me step out for a bit. Is it okay if we meet up in the shared room?"
"Yeah, that's fine. I'll take the first years and do some experiential learning or something."
 I thanked Hashimoto, who was taking on the hassle of being a senpai, and headed to the break room marked "Rest Area".
 When I arrived shortly after, the person who had called me was sitting alone on a two-seater sofa, looking bored out the window. There seemed to be one more person, who was standing and looking out the window. It didn't seem like a coincidence, considering the combination.
"Do you need something from me, Nagumosenpai?"
"Need? Well, it's not so much a need, but I do have something to talk about."
 He said, and made a gesture to call me over with his fingertips.
 I obeyed and sat down on the empty sofa in front of me.
 The person standing by the window, Asahina, turned around at that moment.
"Hey there, Ayanokōji-kun."
 Then she left her spot, pushed Nagumo to the right end of the sofa, and forcibly sat down next to him.
"I was expecting some kind of special test, but it turns out to be just an exchange meeting. I'm honestly disappointed."
 His first words, facing me directly, were of disappointment in this training camp.
"I really have bad luck."
 Nagumo lamented his misfortune, shook his head lightly with a small smile.
"You think so too, don't you?"
 Nagumo, who was leaning on the armrest with his elbow and resting his cheek lightly on it, asked with a look of disgust.
"Indeed, compared to last year's mixed training camp, it's undeniable that this one is a significant scale down. That's probably why it's positioned as an exchange meeting rather than a special test."
 Last year, there was a risk of expulsion, but this year, there isn't even a penalty specified.
 I can understand Nagumo's great disappointment.
"But you knew this was coming, didn't you, Asahina? Considering the timing of the training camp."
"...Yeah, I guess."
 Now that it's February, it's hard to imagine a hard special test involving all grades, Asahina said.

"It would have been virtually impossible for all the third-year students to participate, like last year."
When I muttered that, Nagumo admitted it.
"Many of us third-years are dealing with exams and job hunting at this time. Only students who have already decided their future and have spare time can participate in the training camp. No matter how many private points they can get in return, most of them would rather save every minute and second."
The third-year students had created a rule to collect and manage private points by Nagumo. If they saved up to 20 million points, someone could be pulled into Class A.
However, this time the reward was non-transferable, could only be used within Keyaki Mall, and the amount was not significant.
Even if we take the case of further studies, I'm not familiar with university circumstances, but private university entrance exams generally start from late January. For national and public universities, it would be late February.
Considering that it's early February now, it seems that many students are about to face their main exams.
In such a situation, spending three nights and four days taking care of kōhai is too big a price to pay.
"Last year, the joint training camp was held a month earlier, but wasn't it quite tough for the third-year students even then?"
"I think so. There were quite a few third-year students who brought textbooks. I thought that might be why it was more relaxed this year."
Considering this, Horikita Manabu's generation might have struggled a lot behind the scenes.
Perhaps the school had prepared some relief measures, but now we can't know that.
Even if it's a busy time and it's said to be more relaxed, the third-year students participating in this exchange meeting are likely limited to those who have a clear goal for further studies or employment.
"Can we assume that the third-year students who participated in the exchange meeting did so voluntarily?"
In response to my question, Asahina nods.
"They were recruiting five volunteers from each class. If they didn't reach 20, they planned to reduce the number of groups and adjust."
It seems that the school was also considerate of the third-year students.
"I haven't asked until now, but what will you and Nagumosenpai do after graduation?"
When I ask in the flow of conversation, Nagumo looks up, surprised by the question.
"Do you want to know?"
He seemed pleased to have sparked my interest.
I felt that if I answered vaguely here, he might get upset, so I nodded honestly.
"I'm going to university. I have no intention of using the privilege of Class A."
In other words, he is confident that he can pass on his own merit.
"I'm also going to university like Nagumo. But it's different from him. My self-scoring on the common test for university entrance exams I took recently was close, and it might be a bit impossible at my level. If I can graduate from Class A, I might be able to force my way in with the help of the school... but I probably won't."
The specific name of the university didn't come up, but the university Nagumo is going to seems to be of a high level.
Asahina's decision not to overreach is probably correct. Even if you force your way into a higher-level university with the power of ANHS, there are various risks after admission.
The privilege of Class A is best used for job-related purposes, as Keisei mentioned before.
"I don't see any value in the privilege of Class A itself. Do you know why?"
"Because you have the power to achieve your goals on your own."
"One of the reasons I dominated the third year and became an overwhelming presence is that. Whether I'm in Class B or Class D at graduation, I believe I can get into the university I want and get a job at the company I want with my own power."
Asahina looks at Nagumo next to her with a deliberately disgusted look, but it's probably true.
"Even if everyone unites and drops Nagumosenpai to Class B, the effect is known. That wouldn't raise motivation, it would be hard to maintain. That's what led to the current result."
Nagumo nodded in agreement.
However, of course, it's better to have the privilege of Class A.
The difference is whether you base it on that or consider it as just insurance.
"By the way, Horikitasenpai is also at the university where Nagumo is going. It's a story of how much he likes him."
The deciding factor for the university was not where he wanted to go, but where Horikita Manabu was.
"Leave me alone. If you want, you can take the exam next year and come to the same university. I'll welcome you."
"If I go, I'll have to work really hard on the common test... right?"
"I'll refrain. I think it would be quite difficult with my academic ability."
Unlike Asahina, who honestly accepted my words, it didn't seem to get through to Nagumo.
He laughed at my not serious answer, shrugged his shoulders, and showed it.
"Let's get to the point. Honestly, the only thing you gain from this exchange meeting is private points, and there's nothing to lose. So it's a place where there are fewer people who take it seriously. I'm not just lacking in excitement, but I decided to think positively that it's better than not having it at all."
A game is a game, a match is a match. This will undoubtedly be the last opportunity.
"I thought that was the case. You want to compete with me in this exchange meeting, right?"
"That's right."
For the third-year students, this exchange meeting with little return.

Nagumo had taken the time to make a match with me happen.
Upon hearing those words, Asahina moved her face closer to Nagumo.
"Is that what this is about? It's not fair to treat Ayanokōji-kun badly, right?"
"So, you decided to join us to protect Ayanokōji? You're quite kind."
"But Ayanokōji-kun hasn't done anything wrong. It's not fair that he's being targeted by Nagumo. Why are you so persistent in targeting Ayanokōji-kun?"
Asahina pushed against Nagumo with a force from her shoulder.
But that seemed to have slightly irritated Nagumo, who retorted with a half-smile.
"Do you know why HorikitaSuzune joined the student council, Nazuna?"
"Isn't it because she wanted to follow in her brother's footsteps?"
"No, that's not it. I don't know about now, but that wasn't the case when she first joined."
"Is that so? Then what was her motive?"
"This guy right here. Ayanokōji was using Suzune to keep an eye on me."
"Eh?" Asahina opened her mouth in confusion.
"I suppose he judged me to be a bad student council president, but in the end, that wasn't the case, was it?"
Of course, it wasn't that there were no instances where Nagumo's actions were excessive, but he didn't cause any problematic behavior that warranted strong caution from Horikita Manabu.
"That's true. I think what Nagumosenpai did brought about good changes to the school."
"Maybe you were too influenced by Horikitasenpai, for better or worse?"
Before entering the school, I had no social interactions with others, so it was certain that I was greatly influenced by Horikita Manabu.
The school preferred stability, while Nagumo preferred reform. The two ideologies were never meant to intersect.
"Horikitasenpai did pass the baton to me, after all."
"So you admit it."
"It's too late to deny it now."
"Wait, wait a minute. Eh, what? This is a bit different from what I thought."
Asahina, looking flustered, opened her mouth while looking back and forth between me and Nagumo.
"Despite his deadpan expression, he's pulling strings behind the scenes. Anyway---"
Nagumo paused for a moment before asking again.
"I can assume you're willing to accept a match with me, right?"
"Why do we need to add conditions beyond the rules and rewards prepared for the exchange meeting?"
"I've thought about it, but no. If I, who served as the student council president, were to trap you for personal reasons, it would cause problems."
As Nagumo said, if the two of us, who are not even in the same grade, were to bet big penalties on each other, the school would not be pleased.
"Actually, calling it a match is an exaggeration. It's more like a small bet."
"A bet, you say?"
"Yes. If you win the bet, I'll give you a decent reward."
"So, even if I lose, I don't have to give up my private points?"
"Sounds easy, right?"
It was more like a game than a match or a bet.
However, it was a bit suspicious that only Nagumo was at a disadvantage.
"I see no reason to refuse, but with the current rules, there's not much either of us can do. You're the leader, so you can't participate in the game directly, can you?"
The one directing the students was Kiryūin, in other words, the third-year students.
And the ones fighting were the first and second-year students.
The stage we were put on was different from the start.
"Or are you going to ignore the exchange meeting and have a match in some other way?"
This experiential facility was well-equipped with places and tools to make that happen.
"It wouldn't be bad to have a match outside the exchange meeting, but if we do that, there's no need to stick to this training camp."
"That's true. At school, we could have a more legitimate match."
"If the school says to hold an exchange meeting, I'll follow the formal rules."
Saying that, Nagumo continued.
"At first, I thought about letting you be the leader and having a match by directing the first and second-year students."

On the surface, 3rd-year Kiryūinsenpai was the leader, but I was the one who actually gave the appointments and instructions.
And it seemed that he had anticipated not participating in the game.
"Do you think it's not bad?"
"Well, yeah. But to make it work, we have to give him the power of personnel decisions in the group, otherwise it wouldn't be fair, right?"
Nagumo, who had decided all the group members by himself. On the other hand, if Kiryūin were to entrust the group members he had decided on his own, it certainly wouldn't be a fair starting line.
In fact, we juniors weren't told anything until we got on the bus.
"And when you open the lid, it's a round-robin rule. If you only have one direct confrontation after dragging it out for three days, it's going to lack excitement, right? That's why I thought I'd stop insisting on the same conditions here."
Saying that, Nagumo pointed his index finger at me.
"You participate in all the games. And when you lose three times, that's your defeat."
"I don't have to worry about the group's win or loss, right?"
"Yeah. Even if Kiryūin's group loses 19 times in a row, if you don't lose to anyone, it's a win."
All 19 games. So the condition is to win 17 of them individually.
"You're so kind to let me lose twice."
"If I make undefeated a condition and lose in the first battle, it would be a real turn-off, right? It's more fun to keep you around as long as possible."
Nagumo said he set the line of three losses just for his own enjoyment.
"Eh? Isn't that too disadvantageous for Ayanokōji-kun? Cards are all about luck."
"He has nothing to lose even if he loses, right? The right to set the rules is naturally ours."
"Ah, well, yeah... well, that might be true."
There seemed to be some dissatisfaction, but even if I was confronted with the most harsh content, it was true that there was no reason to refuse if the risk on my side was zero.
"All I want is Ayanokōji's defeat. It's only natural that I make a high-probability demand to win. I'm also offering private points as compensation."
"Is it okay to mess around with kōhai from a distance just before graduation?"
"You're just about right for that."
Either way, it wouldn't hurt to respond to Nagumo's wishes in some way.
He'll be graduating in March anyway.
"Understood. Then I'll accept your consideration without hesitation."
With my acceptance, Nagumo responded with a slight nod.
"Of course, I've told Kiryūin. That you're participating in all the games."
It seemed that negotiations had been conducted behind the scenes on the assumption that I would accept.
"It's not my place to say as an outsider, but you can clearly refuse if you don't like it, you know? Even if you say you won't pay anything when you lose, the fact that you lost will remain."
That's exactly what Nagumo wants, the fact of 'winning' and 'losing'.
"If Ayanokōji says he'll accept, you don't need to say anything unnecessary."
Asahina, who was treated rudely, puffed out her cheeks in dissatisfaction, but backed down when she saw that I was satisfied.
"But you really didn't hold back in your selection, senpai. The students assigned to the other groups were a bit taken aback."
When I pointed that out, he didn't show any dissatisfaction, but rather a smile as if it was natural.
"Even in a trivial exchange meeting, a game is a game. As a former student council president, I have to show my dignity."
It seems that he intends to win even in the exchange meeting where he participates as a leader, apart from the battle with me.
That's Nagumo's freedom, as it's none of my business.
"Even if you start winning in a row, it's easier to stop if you can command directly."
"Wow. You're really ruthless, Miyabi."
"No, I think that's wrong. I think Nagumosenpai's way of thinking is correct."
It's a question of skill to be able to drag your opponent into your own ring after creating a favorable situation for yourself.
Given the structure of only facing each group once and the temperature of this exchange meeting, it's safe to say that it won't be clear how many times a particular individual has participated in the game. That's also a favorable wind direction.
It would be too conspicuous to take on a group as a second-year student, but if it's just an individual battle, it's possible to avoid attention.
While setting the stage for myself to take advantage, he has also taken care of me.
"Nazuna seems to misunderstand, but victory or defeat is not determined solely by whether one is excellent or not. If the person on top is not more capable, using a capable person will only lead to their death."
What Nagumo is saying is correct.
No matter how many pieces you are given in shogi, if your skill is immature, you can't necessarily win.
"I'm sorry I'm late. Has the discussion been settled?"

Kiryūin showed up in the break room.
"Ah, everything's going smoothly. It's going to be a match between me and Ayanokōji as planned. Kiryūin must have sniffed out that I was planning to challenge you and volunteered for this role."
"That's right," Kiryūin nodded.
"If you want, I can even give you the authority as the leader. Of course, on the surface, I'll make it look like I chose the participants. That way, we can compete as a group, can't we?"
He proposed a win-win situation, but I wondered if Kiryūin simply wanted to watch my victory or defeat from the nearest seat without doing anything.
"I see. That was a part that had been bothering me a little. I now understand why those three from Class A ended up in the same group."
When Hashimoto and Morishita stopped by the convenience store, they ran into Yamamura, and Kiryūin happened to be there at the same time.
That might have been the deciding factor in choosing the same group.
When he handed over the authority to me, it was a consideration to save as much time as possible to deepen friendships.
"I don't know much about your current friendships. It was a chance encounter, and I just let you choose randomly. If you're uncomfortable in the group, it'll be hard to show your true abilities, right?"
Thanks to Hashimoto and Hiyori, it seemed like the conversation could go smoothly.
"I appreciate your consideration, but I'll decline your offer. Unfortunately, I'm not good at socializing. I'm too busy trying to get along with my kōhai."
Kiryūin responded with disappointment, but he didn't seem too bothered.
"I didn't expect Kiryūinsenpai to get involved in this matter."
Nagumo and Kiryūin are not exactly friends. Rather, they stand in opposing positions.
When I responded that way, Kiryūin smiled happily.
"Anyway, I'm glad the match seems to be happening, Nagumo. It's a shame that third-year students can't participate in the game directly."
Kiryūin expressed his feelings about the exchange meeting, whether they were true or not.
"If it was a rule that allowed participation, would you have given it your all?"
"It's a rare opportunity involving Ayanokōji, of course, I wanted to meet the expectations."
"Huh. You've really bought into Ayanokōji. If you want, I can challenge you individually, not just in this exchange meeting. If we're both third-years, there's no need to hold back. I'll even bet the ticket price for Class A."
"Sorry, but I'll decline. That ticket price is soaked with the blood and sweat of the entire grade. It's too heavy for me, who hasn't been involved, to accept, isn't it?"
Kiryūin is also a confident type who doesn't consider his own defeat. His words are strong.
He firmly implies that he will win if he competes.
"That's a shame."
But Nagumo is experienced. He doesn't take his opponent too seriously from his three years of association.
"Well then. I have some things to do as a leader, so I'll excuse myself first. Let's meet again later."
After briefly taking care of his business, Kiryūin left.
"Fūka-chan is always cool."
"She's just a woman, after all."
"Wow, that's a terrible thing to say, Nagumo. In this day and age, you can't complain if you're erased."
"Don't get me wrong. I just want to be on top among the same sex, there's no discrimination or anything."
He can't get passionate because she's a different gender.
"Even so, your way of speaking can cause misunderstandings, you know."
That's also a valid point. He wouldn't be punished if he expressed himself a little more tactfully.
When I got up from the sofa, Nagumo and Asahina also stood up.
We left the break room together.
"You should also practice or something and prepare for the match."
"I will."
"Ah, finally you're out. You're done talking, right?"
Just before we disbanded, Amasawa appeared from down the hallway, looking as if she had been waiting impatiently, and approached us.
Nagumo scratched the back of his head at Amasawa's appearance and words.
"Didn't you hear my instructions? I told you to wait, didn't I?"
"It's okay. I work twice as hard during exams."
"I can't trust your words yet. If you do something on your own again, think that you won't have a chance."
"That's harsh. I understand, I'll follow the instructions properly."
"Nagumo, this girl is... um..."
"Amasawa. From first-year Class A."

"Oh, right. You're Amasawa-chan. You must be pretty good to be called into Miyabi's group, huh?"
"Well, not that much..."
It wasn't surprising, given that she had achieved the rare A in both academic and physical abilities on the OAA.
However, when considering overall ability and quick thinking, Amasawa wasn't necessarily the top candidate to be chosen.
"This guy wasn't my pick. Somehow, she heard rumors and knew about the next social gathering."
"That's why I promoted myself. I promised to contribute to the first place."
"Honestly, I was a little hesitant to hire her."
Whether it was due to Amasawa's personality, or suspicion about her relationship with me, Nagumo didn't specify. He probably decided to hire her because he deemed it a minor issue.
"You have to organize your own group too, Nazuna. You're an A student, so aim for the win. Can you always rely on us?"
"Eh, oh my gosh, it's already this late!? I have to go, but feel free to consult me if you have any problems!"
Asahina, who had checked the time on her phone, hurriedly ran off. She almost tripped on her way, but she turned the corner and disappeared.
"I wonder if Nazuna can lead a group with that attitude...?"
Amasawa smirked and leaned in towards Nagumo, who was sighing in disbelief.
"Could it be that you're dating Asahina-senpai?"
"Huh? No, I'm not."
"But you told me to wait because you had important things to discuss with Ayanokōji-senpai, but you kept Asahina-senpai by your side, right? That's special, isn't it?"
It might be a leap to equate special with being a lover, but who knows.
"That's none of your business."
"Eh~ it is. Look, if I'm aiming for Nagumo-senpai, she's my rival."
"You're aiming for a guy who's about to graduate?"
"I'm a patient woman, so I'm tolerant of long-distance relationships."
"Sorry, but I don't like women who pretend to be cute or flatter me."
Amasawa overreacted as if she was hurt by Nagumo's blunt rejection. He probably dislikes that kind of behavior. He deliberately averted his gaze.
"I'm leaving now. Do your best, Ayanokōji."
After Nagumo left, only Amasawa and I were left in the hallway.
"Did I get disliked?"
"Well, if you say things to make yourself disliked, that's what happens."
"But look, Ayanokōji-senpai is also disliked, so I wanted to be in the same group."
What kind of group is that?
"I think it's true that they're not dating, but it does feel special, doesn't it?"
"Well, yeah. It seems like they've gone beyond just being friends."
I agreed with Amasawa on that point, as it made sense.
"By the way, it seems you knew about the social gathering in advance."
"We were told in advance what kind of social gathering would be held."
"We," includes Yagami, who was prepared by that man and managed by Tsukishiro.
It seems they were told the schedule for the year when they entered this school.
If they were going to expel me, it would be better to give them advance information.
"I don't understand why you chose to team up with Nagumo."
"Eh? Isn't it simply because the chances of winning seem high? After all, he was the student council president. I'm a girl of age, so I want private points."
Amasawa answered, but it was clear that she was lying.
However, she didn't seem to be trying to hide her true feelings, and she immediately corrected herself.
"I thought Nagumo-senpai and Ayanokōji-senpai would be competing soon. I thought it might be nice to be on Ayanokōji-senpai's side and support him, but that wouldn't be fun, would it?"
"That's the reason?"
"That's the reason. I thought if I sided with Nagumo-senpai, we might have a good match..."
Amasawa sighed and held her cheek.
"I can see Nagumo-senpai's disappointment. The list the school provided is just full of games. It wouldn't be satisfying to win a game of rock-paper-scissors or cards against him. I didn't need to antagonize him."
"There's nothing we can do about that."
"I heard from Nagumo-senpai first, but the rules are that if Ayanokōji-senpai loses three times, he loses, right? I could feel his desire to see you lose in any way. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens."

"It would be nice if you could look forward to it. But there's a good chance that I could lose three times in a row without any surprises."
In reality, depending on the content, there's a high chance that I could lose without being able to do anything.
"But at least I and Nagumosenpai don't think so."
"Do you understand Nagumo's feelings too?"
"I'm the one who makes fun of it, so I refuse to come to the discussion."
"Did you come here to greet me even though you were refused?"
"Was it not good?"
It's not that it's not good, but there's no reason to force contact with Nagumo and risk his resentment.
In order to get more turns by forming a group, it seems that not only ability but also whether you are liked or not will become a point.
"Well then, I've been called to the group, so I'll go back. See you later."
With a quick turn, Amasawa cheerfully left.
It was a casual conversation with Amasawa, but there was one thing that bothered me.
Amasawa had mentioned that she had been informed about this exchange meeting by Tsukishiro and others in advance, but if so, there was a slight contradiction in the conversation earlier.
"I wonder what she's up to."
It might be a good idea to do a little research.
3
Soon the details of the first round of the exchange meeting were announced and the game began.
Before that, I decided to tell Hashimoto, who was fiddling with his cell phone in the same room, about this matter.
Hashimoto would notice the unnatural phenomenon even if I kept silent about participating in all the games. It's a waste to probe and be probed among friends, and it's to avoid that.
I'm going to have a little fun with Nagumo. I told him lightly about the content, but it was still a match with the former student council president, and Hashimoto couldn't hide his surprise throughout.
And when he finished listening to the story, he sighed repeatedly, showing his understanding of the situation.
"You always do things that are beyond my imagination. You know that, right?"
"It's not the development I wanted."
"Even so, it's an incredible story that you're competing with Nagumosenpai. And it's not about the results of the group battle, but about Ayanokōji's individual performance. That's an amazing story. You're being asked to win 17 out of 19 games."
A tough situation is expected, but Hashimoto seems oddly happy.
"That just means you're being bought. I knew my eyes were right."
"Even if it's a loose exchange meeting, it's still selfish. It qualifies as an act that disrupts the group's circle. That's why I want to ask for an exchange to keep the group's cooperation intact."
"So it's my turn. I understand what you want to say, but I think you don't need to worry."
"What do you mean?"
"Think about it. If this was a fun game, everyone might compete for a seat to participate, but do you think all high school students would want to compete by making pressed flowers and embroidery? No."
I was very interested, but it seems that other students are not.
"So it should be a welcome thing for Ayanokōji to participate in everything."
If things go as planned, I would be grateful.
"Are you going to win the exchange meeting itself? I wonder how Kiryūinsenpai feels about it. I suppose it's okay to assume that you know because of the circumstances?"
"Yeah. But I don't know. I don't think she's completely uninterested, but I don't think she's as excited as Nagumo. She might even throw the whole thing to her juniors."
Kiryūin is only interested in the match with Nagumo based on my performance.
Just enjoying the extra entertainment before graduation, that's all.
"Even if the private points I earned this time can only be used for pocket money, I can use the private points I have now for a more effective use. I honestly want to aim for a higher ranking and get the prize money."
For Hashimoto, who has made enemies both inside and outside, the war chest is indeed important.
"Anyway, Ayanokōji, you should get along with the first year students."
"Get along... huh?"
"Do you think it's a high hurdle to spend time with the first year students in a friendly manner?"
After thinking for a moment, I nodded, and Hashimoto stood up, slapping his knee.
"Alright, if that's the case, let's hurry up and do good. First, I'll loosen up the tension of the first year students and get along with them by tonight."
Hashimoto immediately declared that he had no problem getting closer to the first-year students.
"I'll also try to extract as much information as possible at that time, but if Kiryūinsenpai doesn't move, Ayanokōji's power is indispensable. So when it gets dark, you'll have to cooperate to get along with the first year students, okay?"
I can't just make demands without giving anything in return, and it's only fair to help.
It seems better to support Hashimoto, who is aiming for a win in the group.

"Right... Of course, if I can do it, I want to"
 But it would be better to let him know sooner rather than later that I'm not confident.
 I thought so, but Hashimoto could see through such feelings.
"Leave it to me. I'm pretty good at this kind of thing. I'm grateful to be able to act as Ayanokōji's hands and feet. It will also serve as a check on the princess, and it's not something Ryūen can ignore"
 He was trying to proceed with it as an act that would benefit him while cooperating with me.
 Having a calculating mindset wasn't bad.
 Rather, if there was a clear conflict of interest, it was much better than just being accepted out of goodwill.
"By the way, how much is the congratulatory money when you beat Nagumosenpai?"
"I don't know. I didn't ask for the exact number"
"Considering that he's a third-year representative, it's not a few thousand or tens of thousands, right?"
 What he wanted to know was not the amount, but where the prize money would go.
"I understand. If we win, I'll distribute it properly to the group, so you can rest assured"
"I'm relieved to hear that. However, I'd be happy if you could give me a differential according to my performance, not uniformly"
 He made it clear that he wanted to be paid more for taking the initiative, though it wasn't mandatory.
"Well then, I'll go for a bit. I should be able to have a talk or two during my free time"
 As if cherishing every second, Hashimoto quickly left the shared room.
 〇
 Thus, the first day of the exchange meeting and the first round began.
 The school sent us the game and rules.
 The group we were going to compete against was Group 9. From Horikita's class, Ike and Keisei were participating.
 The game was 'pressed flower making'. The location was a pressed flower classroom.
 Some students might laugh at this when they hear it.
 But I was very serious.
 The question was how to compete with pressed flowers, and in this case, the quality of the finished product was required.
 The combination of many types of flowers.
 Whether or not you can find petals with the right amount of moisture, and the selection of appropriate flower materials of different sizes.
 Whether or not you can finish it without breaking or damaging it because it's delicate.
 The winner would be decided by the total score of these factors.
 Since we had just arrived at the training camp and there were some calls, we hadn't experienced anything yet, so it was a real performance.
 We received a brief lecture just before, but it seemed much deeper than I had imagined.
 The work itself was done by all participants at the same time, and in the end, we competed in a one-on-one format.
 So from the first to the fifth, who would be in charge was decided in advance.
 At the designated production site, there were participants from both groups, 10 people and 2 leaders, and a few galleries including Hashimoto.
 Among them was Takahashi Osamu, a first-year A-class student from the Nagumo group.
 By the way, following the instructions this time, I participated as the third person.
"Do you also make pressed flowers, Ayanokōjisenpai?"
 Nanase Tsubasa from the first-year D-class, who was among the opponents, walked up to me and asked.
"No, I've never done it. I just got a little guidance from a friend"
 By the way, that friend was Hiyori.
 She has been making bookmarks with pressed flowers for a long time and has a lot of experience.
"I see. I thought you were good at it because you were the only boy participating"
 Perhaps because it requires dexterity, as Nanase said, 9 out of 10 participants were girls.
 The only male participants were me, and it was a bit out of place.
 I have a match with Nagumo--- but there's no need to tell Nanase, who is irrelevant.
"I've only done it once or twice, so I don't know if I can do it well"
"Please be gentle"
 I was worried that the scoring criteria might be somewhat vague, but it seemed that the person in charge of pressed flowers who was running the facility was firmly in place and judged strictly.
 Fortunately, the first-year girl who became my opponent as the third person was not very good, so I was able to fight her head-on and win.

And as for the group's win or loss, although the decision was tangled up until the fifth, they barely won with three wins and two losses.
"You're amazing, Ayanokōji-kun. I think you're doing very well for your first time."
"I'm nowhere near as good as Hiyori though."
Both were beautiful pressed flowers at first glance, but the quality was worlds apart.
If she had been an opponent, she would have been utterly defeated.
"You have a knack for this, Ayanokōji-kun. Let's make it together next time, if you like."
"Yeah, I'd like to get better at this too."
Relieved that a formidable opponent was an ally, it was significant that he had won in the individual competition.
If possible, he would have liked to stay in the pressed flower class and quietly continue making them.
He wouldn't mind doing pressed flowers for three days straight.
Such feelings were welling up, but unfortunately, he had to suppress them.
Sorry, pressed flowers, see you later...
After the first match, Kiryūin secretly called out to me.
"It's a good start with a victory. I didn't feel any tension though."
"Well, that's true."
While answering, I kept quiet about how serious I had been.
Since whispering was allowed during production, it was inevitable that the watching gallery would find it boring.
"But if it's a competition based on experiential learning, it's not strange for anyone to win or lose. If you consider the school's intentions, it's a very interesting way to decide. It's meaningless to just gather students with high OAA abilities. Every group has a chance to win."
Even the great Nagumo couldn't foresee or determine whether Horikita and the others could make good pressed flowers.
That being said, the same could be said for us.
What we can and can't do. Use the spare time to experience as many experiential learning activities as possible and improve our skills. As a leader, I should be fulfilling these roles...
"Hashimoto made this list for me, which makes things easier. He's surprisingly useful."
To avoid the hassle as a leader, Kiryūin seemed to welcome it.
Well, that's fine too. It's good to enjoy the three days without getting too serious about winning.
"If we continue like this, there will be almost no need for senpai to take command."
"I'm grateful for that. All I want to see is the match between Ayanokōji and Nagumo."
As expected, he didn't seem to have any intention of doing anything basic.
"I don't think the results will meet your expectations."
While having such a conversation with Kiryūin, I noticed Inogashira was looking at us alone.
Judging from the situation, he probably didn't participate in the first game.
He said he was good at sewing, and he might like pressed flowers too.
I thought he had come to experience pressed flowers in his spare time, but it didn't seem to be the case.
"What's up, Inogashira?"
When I asked him out of curiosity, he approached me with a bit of nervousness. Seeing this, Kiryūin stepped back to make it easier for him to talk.
"Um...uh, you're good friends with Kōenji-kun, aren't you, Ayanokōji-kun?"
"Huh?"
I answered immediately. It was the first time I had heard that I was good friends with Kōenji.
"Is that so? ...I see..."
"What's the matter?"
"Well, >>>Tatebayashi<<<senpai told me to bring Kōenji-kun back..."
>>>Tatebayashi<<< is the leader of the group to which Inogashira and Kōenji belong, the third-year D class.
"He was really angry."
"Yes..."
As a member of the same group and classmate, it seems that the timid Inogashira was forced to take responsibility.
"I thought maybe Ayanokōji-kun could do something about it..."
He had been watching the scene earlier and our eyes had met.
He must have come to ask for help out of desperation, but the problem was that the other party was too difficult.
"Why don't you ask Yōsuke?"

I tried to offer the most feasible solution, but Inogashira shook his head.
"I can't ask Hirata-kun to do something like this... It's too much to ask."
I wonder if it's okay to ask me...? Well, it's rude to compare myself to Yōsuke, who is very helpful. If asked, he would accept and if Kōenji didn't return, he would likely continue to persuade him until he did. I can understand why Inogashira feels guilty.
"I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't be of any help."
"I see... I'm sorry, I'll try to figure something out..."
Inogashira bowed his head slightly and walked away slowly.
"Should we just leave it like this?"
"I do feel sorry for him, but that man won't act according to our wishes. We've tried various things over the past two years, and this is our conclusion."
"Of course, the decision is up to you. Regardless of the details, the fact that she came to us first is significant."
"You're serious in strange ways. I won't deny it, but I'm not enthusiastic about it."
My thoughts and policies towards Kōenji had solidified the last time I interacted with Mii-chan. Now, without a special exam threatening expulsion, any unnecessary contact and communication would be a waste.
"There's still some time until the next game, why not give it a shot? From what I've seen, >>>Tatebayashi<<<'s group is small and unlikely to win, but if Kōenji is competent, the situation might turn around somewhat. Right?"
He doesn't seem like the type to worry about others, but it would be inappropriate for me to say that.
I want to have various experiences, but opportunities seem hard to come by.
"I understand. I'll try to make contact for now. If Kōenji wins, he might appreciate the private points he'll earn."
"That's a good idea."
In fact, that's the only element that could potentially motivate Kōenji.
While thinking that I had been asked to do something troublesome, I decided to give it a shot.
5
During the 30-minute interval. I wanted to find Kōenji during that time, but it wasn't an easy task.
I went to Kōenji's shared room, but as expected, he wasn't there, and he wasn't in the lobby or the lounge either.
After wandering around the building for about 5 minutes, occasionally asking acquaintances for information, I obtained a promising clue with about 20 minutes left until the next game.
I found Kōenji a little way up a mountain path behind the building.
I arrived at an open ground that used to be used as a dog run.
It seemed to have become quite a wasteland, perhaps because it was no longer in use.
"It took a lot of effort to find this place. So you were here."
I found Kōenji, who was running joyfully, kicking up the wasteland with his strong horse-like legs.
I couldn't help but wonder what he was doing alone, but if I worried about it, I would lose to Kōenji.
Seeing a rare spectator, Kōenji slowed down and approached me.
I thought he would continue to ignore me, but it was a bit surprising.
"Ayanokōji boy. Do you need something from me?"
I think it's just a whim, but I can't waste this opportunity.
"I saw you leaving the group on your own. I thought I'd ask you about your feelings."
"I see. As long as you didn't come to call me back because someone was counting on my power, that's fine."
I guess this man doesn't need any pretense.
"Inogashira was looking for you with a troubled face."
"So what?"
"Why don't you go back and help the group a little?"
"You already know the answer, don't you?"
"I don't know. Why won't you cooperate?"
"I'll tell you something special. 1+1=2. The answer doesn't change no matter how many times you solve it."
"That depends on how you look at it. In decimal, that's true, but in binary, 1+1=10."
Kōenji didn't lose his smile even when I responded with a ridiculous answer to his ridiculous statement.
"Hahaha. You have a sense of humor. But your answer is nonsense. You see things in a twisted way, with a logic-biased thinking. 1+1=2 is the answer. The world is always simple and clear."
Kōenji expressed again that he had no intention of getting along with me.
"They should win with their own tactics, even without my power. Isn't that right?"
"Your group doesn't have that power. That's why I intended to consider Kōenji. If you show your presence here, your impression will improve. Won't it be easier for you in the future?"
"I pride myself on being the only, the best, and the strongest person. There's no need to show that to others. Your questions are all nonsense."


Kōenji sneered and turned his back to me.
"This time, I've decided to take a complete break. In other words, I'm not involved in the exchange meeting at all. The game can be played smoothly with just five people, right? Please make sure to convey that."
Indeed, there was no obligation for all group members to gather and hold an exchange meeting.
If Kōenji was uncooperative, it was a waste of time to invite him.
"I can't say it to others, but I can't do anything about the uncooperative part that I can't understand."
"Hmm. Incomprehensible, huh? Do you want to know why I'm uncooperative?"
As I was about to give up and turn back, he stopped me.
"Are you going to tell me?"
"I don't mind. But before that, can I ask you a question?"
When I turned back, Kōenji started talking.
"If a paper test is conducted here without any prior notice. Let's say, a test that questions basic academic abilities, who do you think would win, you or me?"
If it wasn't Kōenji, I wouldn't have answered seriously.
But here, I intuitively felt that it was best to speak from the heart.
"I would win."
Without hesitation, I answered immediately, but Kōenji wasn't surprised.
Rather, he immediately responded as if it was the answer he had expected.
"Your high confidence is not bad. Let's assume that your answer is yes in this situation. Then, do you think that our superiority, excellence, and value as human beings are determined by that alone?"
"No. That alone doesn't determine it."
It's just a difference in the written test on basic academic abilities.
"Then next---if you and I fight seriously, what do you think the result will be?"
A question about strength, not about brains or anything like that.
Having watched Kōenji Rokusuke for two years, I already had the answer in my mind.
"If it's a fight based on specific rules, I think Kōenji has the advantage."
In terms of physique and muscle mass, Kōenji would undoubtedly be superior.
This is a number that cannot be overturned.
If rules are imposed here, such as boxing or judo, and Kōenji's skills are at least equal, I cannot deny the possibility of a tough battle.
"That's a funny expression. It's a different answer from mine, but I'll evaluate your thought as it is."
From Kōenji's point of view, there is no possibility of losing, regardless of the presence or absence of rules. Of course, no one can deny that unless they actually fight.
"Do you think you can judge who is above or below with just this information?"
"It's a difficult question. But if I think about it in general terms, a third party would have to objectively and fairly evaluate both sides from various comprehensive perspectives, including not only written tests but also physical aspects, and quantify them. But that doesn't mean they can relativize human value."
"That's correct. No matter how objectively you look at it, it's not easy to determine human value. Even if you talk about comprehensive perspectives, you can't see everything."
"If you have to compare, I would support the method I just mentioned."
"I disagree, Ayanokōji boy."
"Then, how do you judge the value of a person?"
As if waiting for me to ask that, Kōenji grinned.
"The answer is extremely simple. Whether it's me or not me. That determines the superiority or inferiority."
Even though he made me think a bit, in the end, it comes down to that.
"What's the basis for your confidence?"
"I'll gladly tell you. The source is adaptability. I won't succumb to any environment. I have the confidence to survive in any environment. Whether it's in a large corporation or a jungle full of beasts, I have the power to adapt perfectly and perfectly. This is something that a third party cannot measure."
He must be well aware that "perfect" and "perfect" are redundant.
"The long question and answer session was meaningless. Even if you're perfect, it has nothing to do with your reason for not cooperating, does it?"
"If so, it's just that you didn't understand. Can you stand shoulder to shoulder with kindergarteners who can't do anything and work seriously? There's that much of a gap between me and the people around me. The reason I went out of my way to get first place in the deserted island test was to distance myself from such kindergarteners."
He doesn't feel like competing side by side because he looks down on those around him.
That was Kōenji's reason for being uncooperative.
"You're not suited for this school."
"You and I are completely different beings, but I thought you had a somewhat similar perspective. I didn't expect you to say that. I also think it would be more meaningful to devote myself to training by revisiting China than entering this school. I have circumstances that prevent me from doing so."
No matter how I think about it, it's a dead end.
When it comes down to it, whether to cooperate or not is a decision he has to make.

I couldn't blame Kōenji for sticking to his guns.
"It's a shame, Kōenji. If you were different, you could attract more attention in a better way."
"Like you, who's starting to be relied on by those around you?"
"I'm not really attracting much attention, though."
We had our conversation.
Strangely enough, I often had the opportunity to talk with Kōenji like this.
I wondered if the atmosphere was similar at last year's training camp.
I was reminded again of the enigma that was the person in front of me.
"You understand now that you can't control me, don't you?"
"Yeah, I guess so."
"So why do you bother with me? I'm not even in your group this time."
Indeed, it was a strange story.
If someone else looked at my situation now, they would all say I should just leave it alone.
It could waste time and potentially affect my bet with Nagumo.
"Even though I know it's useless, I can't help but try---"
"Because if you step out of the class, you won't be able to protect Horikita girl, right?"
As if linking with my thoughts, Kōenji said so.
I saw Kōenji as a hindrance to Horikita, who would continue to fight in the future.
This man saw through that.
His extraordinary instinct was truly unpredictable.
Despite not giving many hints, he seemed to feel what was coming.
"If that's the case, there's no need to hesitate. You can try to exclude me at any time."
"Didn't I tell you before that I don't feel like doing that?"
"Huhuhu. Well, if that's the case, there's nothing I can do."
Kōenji, who never doubted that he was the best human being.
So far, there have been several people who I have urged to improve for the future of Horikita's class.
I've done the same with other classes if I thought they were beneficial.
This man, who is excellent in ability but difficult in personality, is similar.
But the reason I don't urge Kōenji to improve is because I judge the risk and effort of the treatment to be high.
Just as you can't turn an incompetent person into a competent one with a simple task like flipping a coin.
The man in front of me wouldn't change with just one or two steps.
It's easier to eliminate him before he becomes a nuisance than to change him into a force. That's my conclusion.
"See you later then. I'll go back to my time of self-improvement."
Seeing that further conversation would be useless, Kōenji started running again.
After watching his back for a moment, I decided to turn back.
6
I came back near the training camp building to report on Kōenji's case.
But I couldn't find Kiryūin, and I didn't know where she had gone.
When I asked a few people, they told me there was a handmade park on the east side of the building, and they saw her walking there.
There wasn't much time until the next game, so I wondered what she was doing there.
The handmade park had several wooden playground equipment.
Unlike the rusty dog run, this place seemed to be still in use, with seesaws and balance beams that looked usable.
Now, where was Kiryūin--- she was on one of the two swings.
Not alone, but with Asahina, a third-year student.
From a distance, it looked like Asahina was happily talking to her, and Kiryūin was listening with a warm gaze.
I thought it was an unusual combination as I approached to tell her about Kōenji.
"We don't usually have a chance to talk, so it's kind of fresh... really unusual, isn't it?"
"Are you that happy to talk to me?"

"I'm glad. Fūka-chan is always so cool. A lot of girls really look up to her."
Asahina's eyes sparkled, perhaps she was the type to be more popular with girls than boys.
This must be because she rarely interacts with students of the same grade.
I think Kiryūin is a special case, but it seems that this kind of interaction is also happening.
"Ayanokōji, you're back."
"What were you talking about?"
It seemed better to tell him about Kōenji's situation later. With that thought, I asked about the content of the conversation.
"We were talking about various things, but right now we were talking about our future plans. I was curious about Fūka-chan's plans."
I remember she said she would become a special student and go to university when we met before.
"So, which university are you going to?"
The conversation had just started, and Asahina asked that question.
Kiryūin openly mentioned the name of a specific university as her future destination.
It was a famous university that I would have heard of many times if I had lived normally.
"It's their law department. But I'm not particularly attached to the department."
Asahina shuddered at the thought of going to such a high-level university, thinking it was impossible for her.
"What do you plan to do, Fūka-chan?"
"Hmm? I don't plan to become anything. I don't intend to become anyone."
Just as she had told me before, she planned to live as an ordinary person.
She told Asahina that.
"Eh~. Isn't that a bit of a waste? Fūka-chan seems like she could become anything."
She had no intention of showing off her talents, which would be envied by those who didn't have them.
That might be a waste, but it might also be the ultimate luxury.
"I can become anything. I'm not without confidence, but there are many different things."
"So you don't have a dream?"
"I have a dream of not becoming anyone. Does that answer your question?"
"That might be a dream, but I think it's better to have a big dream. Whether you can become it or not, whether you can do it or not, isn't it something to think about?"
Especially if you're Asahina, who is expected to graduate from Class A. Kiryūin understood this and laughed.
"That's true. It's not that I've never thought about such a dream."
"Then tell me. I might aim for it too."
Kiryūin reluctantly told Asahina, who kept her eyes sparkling.
"If I had to choose a job to achieve something, I might aim to be a politician."
"A politician!? Wow... but it's not common to think of becoming a politician... even Masa has never mentioned becoming a politician, and I've never seen anyone around me do it."
Asahina, eager to know how she came to have that dream, listened attentively.
"Do I have to talk about it?"
"No? I think this might be the last chance to talk slowly... I want to hear it."
At Asahina's request, Kiryūin said it was special and revealed the reason.
"When I was little, I had a lot of opportunities to meet politicians because of my family relationships."
"Oh, so that's why you wanted to become one?"
"No? Because I had such opportunities, I thought I should never become a politician. I just let their talk go in one ear and out the other."
"Ah, it's a prejudice, but... politicians seem to be mostly bad people."
"That's right. Most of them were corrupt people who were often featured on TV and in the media. It's not a profession I admire at all."
If that's the case, there must be another reason why she mentioned it as a dream.
"Because it's such a corrupt world, there are also those who shine. He was one of the few people I admired."
"What's the name of the politician? Do I know him?"
"It's Kijima-san. He's become quite important now."
"Eh, Kijima? Eh? The Prime Minister?"
Kiryūin affirmed. Asahina seemed quite surprised.
"I thought it wouldn't be bad to aim for the same stage as him, who is active on the front line."

"But you're not aiming for that... right?"
"I don't plan to at the moment."
"It seems like you, Fūka-chan, could even become a politician."
"Didn't I tell you there's a lot going on?"
The more she stood out, the more she hated having the Kiryūin name follow her around.
"Why don't you aim to be a politician instead of me, fulfilling my dream? Ayanokōji."
"That's quite an unexpected suggestion. I've never even considered a career in politics."
"My intuition tells me you might do surprisingly well."
"I'm fine with being ordinary. I'll go to some suitable university and get a suitable job."
"I see. Since I'm also aiming for the same path, we're both dream chasers in our own way."
"Whether it's Masa or Fūka-chan, inviting Ayanokōji-kun, it must be something special, huh?"
"I'm just being targeted by a curiosity seeker. The next game is about to start."
If we continued talking, we wouldn't be able to avoid being late.
"Oh, is it that time already? I need to hurry!"
Asahina jumped off the swing and waved frantically at us.
"See you later!"
"Don't rush and fall."
"I know! Whoa, whoops!"
She almost fell as she started running.
I didn't expect to see the same pattern twice in one day, let alone in such a short time.
"Did you get to meet Kōenji?"
"I did talk to him. It was a waste of time though."
I told her the purpose of my visit here, that I couldn't get Kōenji to participate in the exchange meeting.
"I see. So Kōenji is uncontrollable after all, huh?"
"I tried to find a way in, but there was no opening."
"So there are things even you can't do, Ayanokōji. I'm glad."
I was praised for my inability.
"Did you send me to see this result?"
"I can't deny that I wanted to see it."
I thought it was strange to favor another group, but she's a rather mean-spirited senpai.
"But Tatenobashi is harsh. It's true that I can't bear to see a kōhai being oppressed."
"It would be nice if he could be tough on Kōenji, but it doesn't affect him."
Besides, there's a huge difference in ability.
Considering the possibility that Kōenji might bare his fangs, it wouldn't be strange for Tatenobashi to direct his stress towards another person in the group.
"Well, we can't help it. Let's move on to the second match."
The game proceeded as follows.
'Pottery'
Everyone was a beginner, so it was a low-level battle. I took the lead with my dexterity and won.
'Table tennis'×2
It was the same game twice in a row, but I had some experience with table tennis at school, so I won easily.
'Jewelry making'
I was worried about how it would go, similar to pressed flowers, but my opponent was also inexperienced, so I was able to compete on equal terms.
Including the pressed flowers, Takahashi was following all the games, probably because Nagumo had instructed him to confirm the results.
I thought I would be forced into a game with more elements of luck, but overall it was a good first day.
And perhaps influenced by my five consecutive wins, the group also managed to win five games in a row without losing.
〇A request from Horikita and a request from Ayanokōji
The night of the first day of the exchange meeting.
The biggest difference from last year's camp must be here.

The shared rooms assigned to each group were divided by grade level. In other words, first and second year students slept in the same room. Depending on their personalities, this could be the most troublesome time for both first and second year students. That's why Hashimoto had created an environment where they could get to know each other early on. It seemed to be working, as the first-year students were already able to talk to Hashimoto with a smile. Among the eight people in this room, I was the one who was least familiar with everyone else. 

"You did great winning all your matches on the first day, Hashimotosenpai."
"We didn't know who our opponents would be, so we honestly had no idea what would happen."
Toyohashi and Yanagi happily said so. 
Today's third and fourth rounds, each of them had a turn at table tennis, which probably influenced their mood. 
>>>Shintoku<<< and >>>Kobayakawa<<< also seemed to agree, nodding vertically several times, but they seemed a bit reserved. 
"I'm sorry. We haven't participated even once yet..."
"Don't worry about it. From what I saw today, about half of the students haven't participated yet. Honestly, the game element is really just a bonus. Even the students who haven't participated have a job to experience it."
The experiential learning format, where students collect stamps on a point card, was initially met with skepticism, but it seemed to be more actively participated in than expected. It provided a good opportunity to deepen friendships by inviting friends and senpai-kōhai. 
There were no groups that were aggressively seeking to win in the five matches held today, but perhaps that freedom had an impact. 
However, that didn't mean it was easy to reach first place. 
Considering today's game progress, a tough battle was expected from tomorrow onwards. 
There were four groups, including ours, that won all five matches. Three groups won four out of five matches. There were also four groups that lost all five matches. As can be seen from the distribution of wins and losses, it was clear that the exchange meeting had a polarized policy. 
There might be some groups that are seriously engaged among those that have won one or two matches, but it's uncertain what will happen if they can't break into the top ranks from tomorrow onwards. 
From the second day onwards, it seemed that we would be competing for the championship with about half of the groups. 
"Nagumosenpai's group is a championship contender, isn't it?"
Takumi Oda of the second year C class muttered, reflecting on the five matches. 
"I thought so too. They seem to have won all their matches as well."
The strength of that group was that many of the students were serious. 
It was safe to say that the fact that there was not a single student who thought it was okay to slack off directly contributed to their win rate. 
It was easy to imagine that they were letting their members have various experiences and accumulate experience. 
While there was an aspect of being able to compete equally because it wasn't a battle of academic ability, it could also be said that the gap was easily created because many of the students were inexperienced in many of the games. 
"By the way, Hashimotosenpai, about my class---"
The conversation wasn't just about the exchange meeting, but also included trivial personal topics. 
I watched the conversation of the seven people, feeling somewhat detached. 
Even though the group had only been together for a few hours, the first-year students already seemed to admire Hashimoto, and the conversation was naturally lively with Hashimoto at the center. 
As expected of someone who prided himself on his ability, there was no other way to put it. 
He was beginning to build relationships as if they had been acquaintances or friends for a long time. 
Yōsuke and others who were good at blending in with their surroundings fit the bill, but he was a different type. 
What I was a little dissatisfied with was that Oda had also managed to fit in quite well...
"But, it was a surprising day in many ways."
Hashimoto groaned, holding a memo in his hand that recorded the wins and losses of each group announced by the school. 
"Ryūen's group lost twice, and Sakayanagi's group even lost three times. They might drop out of the championship race tomorrow."
Today, we didn't have a match with either of those two groups, so the details were unknown. 
If Hashimoto hadn't taken on the role of organizing the first-year students, he might have gathered more information, but it seemed that he couldn't manage that. 
"It's surprising. I've always had the impression that Sakayanagisenpai is strong. I wonder if it's different because a third-year student is in command."
According to the OAA, a third-year D class student named >>>Iki<<< had generally poor grades. Especially in terms of academic ability, his grade was D+, which was quite unsatisfactory. From this, it seemed unlikely that he was participating as part of the college-bound group. 
"If Sakayanagi wanted to win, it would be normal for her to take command, regardless of whether it's a third year or whatever. She wouldn't back down even if her opponents were Nagumosenpai or Kiryūinsenpai. Especially >>>Iki<<<senpai, right? No matter how you think about it, she would quickly seize control... No, even before that, she's the type who would want to leave everything to competent comrades."
It seemed that Hashimoto knew a little bit about what kind of person >>>Iki<<< was. 
"So, is it simply a lack of strength?"
>>>Kozumi<<<, who had been quiet until now, muttered that, but Toyohashi immediately denied it. 
"At least the first year has quite a good member. The second year is probably the same, right?"
As Toyohashi said, the group Sakayanagi was assigned to was not that bad. >>>Iki<<< also seemed to have chosen reasonably competent members from both grades, considering the possibility of winning.

So it was only natural that Hashimoto questioned why he had lost to an opponent he considered inferior in today's match.
"Whether it's a special test or a social gathering, Sakayanagi always aims to win."
Hashimoto, who had been by her side all along, knew this better than anyone.
Looking at the results of the three losses, Hashimoto must have had doubts in his mind.
"I think so too. I wonder if she's up to something."
Oda also seemed to be troubled by Sakayanagi's three losses and was deep in thought.
However, thinking about it here wouldn't yield any answers.
Eventually, the seven of them started to get excited about a completely unrelated topic.
After a while, Hashimoto distanced himself from the first-year students and walked over to me, who had been watching from afar. On his way, he picked up the TV remote and deliberately turned on a variety show to make the room noisy.
"Could it be that the damage from losing Kamuro is big?"
Hashimoto, who wanted to confirm the reason for the three losses, asked me this.
"Maybe."
It was difficult to judge based on the current results alone, but there was no evidence to the contrary.
"If she's really getting weaker, it's a good thing for me. If we go into the end-of-year exams like this, I might have a chance to win."
As he said, Hashimoto wasn't simple enough to take these results at face value.
"Can you find out what the real situation is with Sakayanagi, Ayanokōji?"
"That's Hashimoto's specialty, not mine."
I tried to refuse immediately, but Hashimoto whispered in my ear just in case.
"Please spare me this time. I'm the man most feared by Class A right now. Especially Kitō, he seems to be really angry. It's okay for now because Sakayanagi hasn't said anything, but who knows what will happen when my betrayal becomes clear."
He muttered as he imagined it and hugged himself.
But his expression remained faintly amused.
"You don't seem to be scared, do you?"
"If I can't even bluff, I don't deserve to betray the class."
That made sense too.
"Besides, I've moved on thanks to Ayanokōji. I'm grateful for that too."
Hashimoto, who had visited my room on the day of the two-person meeting, had laid himself bare.
Now he can face forward thanks to the benefits of that time, but the effect is probably temporary.
Once the impact of his betrayal begins to take effect, it will no longer be the case.
Hashimoto's time is running out.
"Ayanokōji can contact Sakayanagi directly, right?"
It's fine to feel a little better, but that's one thing, this is another.
"You can hope for whatever you want, but when did I become Hashimoto's ally? I don't intend to stick my neck into any trouble."
"I'm thinking of it separately. But at least in this social gathering, we're comrades. Even if she's lost three times, as long as Sakayanagi is there, she's a candidate for the championship that we should be wary of. Considering that we might face each other tomorrow, it's not a bad idea to scout her out now."
The man who doesn't care much about group battles is brave in his public statements.
"That's a reasonable reason. But as long as you and I are in the same group, Sakayanagi will be more wary than usual. I don't want you to expect useful information."
"I understand, I'll just consider it as a bonus, okay?"
"...Alright. I'll just move as much as I can for now."
"I'm counting on you."
I also wanted to know the reason for the three losses.
Whether or not I will pass on the information I gain to Hashimoto is another matter.
1
The quickest way to contact Sakayanagi is, needless to say, to contact her directly. However, it would be difficult to know her current situation in detail. She might speak honestly to me, but I can also predict that there will be many parts she will intentionally hide.
Another option is to indirectly extract information from someone who knows Sakayanagi's current situation in detail.
But this also carries risks. It's unavoidable that they will know that I'm interested in Sakayanagi's details. Hondō and Shinohara from Horikita's class are assigned to the same group as Sakayanagi, but neither of them are the type to keep their mouths shut or be good at acting.
For now, I decided to go out to the lobby and slowly organize my thoughts.
Depending on the timing, I might be able to find Sakayanagi out and about.
"Ayanokōji-kun"
As I moved to the lobby, one student noticed me and approached.

It was Sanada from the same class as Sakayanagi.
He seemed to have just gotten out of the bath, as his hair was wet and I could see a few droplets of water on his glasses.
"Can we talk for a bit? There's something I've been meaning to ask you."
"I don't mind. What did you want to ask?"
I was also grateful to have run into Sanada.
On the first day, I had won a game against the group Sakayanagi belonged to.
"It's about Hashimoto-kun from the same group. I guess you've heard various rumors about him."
"Like he had a hand in Kamuro's expulsion?"
"I don't intend to pry into it without any solid evidence, but regardless of the truth, I'm curious about his current situation... I wonder how he's doing."
Currently, not only Sakayanagi but also Hashimoto from Class A are attracting a lot of attention.
It wouldn't be strange if there were students like Sanada who were concerned about them.
"There's nothing particularly different from usual. He seems to be doing well, not just putting on a brave face."
"I see... That's good."
"But what about Sakayanagi? Has anything changed with her?"
Following the flow of the conversation, I tried to touch on Sakayanagi.
"As far as I could see at school, she seemed to be the same as always."
"I thought the fact that her group has lost three times at the exchange meeting might have had some effect."
"I'm not sure. But that might be the case. However, since we came here, we haven't seen each other much, so I don't know the details."
At least for now, Sanada answered that he didn't have a grasp on the situation.
"But didn't you play a game with Sakayanagi's group today?"
When I pointed that out, Sanada quietly shook his head.
"She didn't participate. I didn't see her giving any instructions nearby either."
She might have just been absent from that game, but it seems more likely at this point that she hasn't been involved in the exchange meeting at all.
"What about you, Ayanokōji-kun? Do you know anything?"
"Unfortunately, no. The information I have is probably the same as Sanada's."
In fact, I might even have less information.
"I'd be happy if you could keep an eye on Hashimoto-kun, as well as Sakayanagi-san, even a little."
"As a member of the same group, I intend to keep an eye on them as much as possible. But, I don't know the details, so it's not my place to interfere. What do the classmates actually think? Do they think Hashimoto really betrayed them?"
"That is---"
Unable to answer immediately, Sanada couldn't continue his words.
"I haven't talked directly with my classmates, so I can't say for sure who thinks what. But there are definitely people who assume that's the case."
The first person who came to mind from the conversation with Hashimoto earlier was Kitō.
He's a man of few words, but he's always been obedient to Class A.
And he and Kamuro seemed to get along well, as they were often together.
After that, I talked with Sanada a little more, and then I spotted Horikita looking at us from a distance. She seemed to want to talk to me, so I ended the conversation at a reasonable point.
As soon as I was alone, Horikita approached me. Even though there are only 20 seniors, it seems that the chances of running into someone are high due to the large number of people.
"I'm glad I ran into you. I have a little favor to ask... Is that okay?"
Horikita, who started off with a generous attitude, didn't seem to have a problem with the exchange meeting.
It's common knowledge that the Nagumo group has been undefeated and in first place with five consecutive wins since the first day.
"What's the favor?"
When I asked back, Horikita pulled my sleeve and forced me to move to the edge of the lobby.
"It's about Amasawa-san... It's not something I can talk about loudly."
"She's in your group, isn't she? Did something happen?"
When it comes to confidential talks, the first thing that comes to mind is trouble.
But that guess seemed to be off, as she immediately denied it.
"She talks a little too much, but she hasn't done anything problematic. She's been a good girl so far."
Relieved at that, I waited for Horikita to continue.
"Do you know that she has high physical abilities? It seems that she is also quite skilled in martial arts."

"Setting martial arts aside, I do watch OAA and have a rough grasp of it."
While giving a noncommittal response, I urged for more information since the full picture was not yet clear.
"I think you wouldn't know unless you heard it from Amasawa-san, but I owe her a bit of a 'debt'. Something I can't repay in normal school life."
Martial arts, and the word 'debt'.
Although she avoided direct expression, it seemed that she had a confrontation with Amasawa at some point.
Looking back, without thinking deeply, it seemed that the only stage for such a confrontation would have been the deserted island test.
"It's hard to imagine the circumstances."
I decided to say something that most people would say upon hearing this story.
"Well, various things."
Horikita evasively responded, showing no intention of elaborating on the 'debt'. 
Since it wasn't something I needed to pry into, I decided to move on.
"So, what's next?"
"I've been doing my best every day. But I don't know if I'm at a level that can compete with her. So, I want you to evaluate my current strength."
"I understand you want to repay your debt to Amasawa, but it sounds quite dangerous."
"It would be under normal circumstances. But her strength is not ordinary."
"Even if you say 'strength', I don't know how strong Amasawa is. I can't be of much help."
Without knowing the exact strength of the opponent, preparing a measure is meaningless.
---Well, in reality, I do know.
But I decided to keep that to myself.
"You just need to judge my strength in your own way. Of course, I would be happy if you could give me some advice."
From her tone, it seemed that she might be more interested in the advice.
"It's up to you if you want a rematch, but have you gotten Amasawa's consent?"
"Not yet."
But, Horikita quickly continued.
"If she refuses my proposal, I won't force her."
Despite her answer, it seemed that Horikita didn't consider the possibility of Amasawa refusing.
After all, she had gone to the trouble of confiding in me and asking for special training.
"Would you... accept my request?"
"Accepting is a problem in itself."
Facing Amasawa would be quite disadvantageous.
No matter how much Horikita had trained after her defeat, it was unlikely that the gap in their abilities could be easily closed.
"Why don't you ask Ibuki over there? She would be happy to help."
I called out to someone who was probably hiding nearby and listening in.
"Tch, you noticed."
With an annoyed click of her tongue, Ibuki showed her face from around the corner of the hallway.
It was clear that this was a prearranged plan between the two, as Horikita didn't seem surprised.
"Unfortunately, I'm tired of sparring with Ibuki-san. There's little to gain from fighting the same opponent over and over."
Ibuki, standing next to her, seemed to have a similar 'debt', showing a similar reaction.
It seemed that this was a request made after doing everything they could.
"You're strong, so you should be willing to help a little."
"Are you also up for it, Ibuki?"
"Of course. I can't stand losing to a first-year girl."
After throwing a few punches, she showed off a beautiful high kick.
She seemed desperate to land that kick.
It's nice to be enthusiastic, but even though she referred to Amasawa as a little girl, there's only a one-year difference between them, and in terms of physique, Ibuki is actually smaller...
"You decided to do this during the training camp because you wouldn't have trouble finding a place to spar, right?"
"It would be too conspicuous to have a battle rematch at school."
Horikita, who gave a small nod in response, seemed determined. Ibuki too, for that matter.

"I wonder...? Honestly, it's a story with no merit for you..."
"Indeed, there's no return for me."
"But if you would accept, I'm prepared to offer private points as compensation---"
She seemed ready to offer compensation, but it was pointless to accept such a thing.
"I don't know how much it will help, but if you accept the conditions, I'm willing to take it on."
I interrupted Horikita's offer and responded.
"Really? I wasn't expecting that at all..."
"Whether we agree or not, it's more of a disadvantage to fight at school. If you want to repay a favor, you wouldn't want to miss a great opportunity. That said, I can't go out in the middle of the night."
"Thank you. I couldn't ask for more cooperation. So, what are the conditions?"
There were absolute conditions that had to be accepted in order to face Amasawa in a rematch.
"The first is to settle things with Amasawa today. You're in the same group, so it shouldn't be hard to find an opportunity to talk. Of course, to avoid making a fuss, make sure no third party finds out. The timing should be early morning on the last day. You should get Amasawa to accept at that time."
The chances were slim, but if she refused, the special training would be meaningless.
"Of course, I understand that. What are the other conditions?"
"I'll talk about that once you've cleared this one. There's no point in special training if Amasawa doesn't accept. Besides, we can't do it in the middle of the night at the camp, can we?"
Since this was a discussion based on the premise that we would accept, there should be no objections even if all the conditions were not heard.
"I'm ready to do it right now, you know?"
"You should keep quiet."
Horikita, unlike Ibuki, had a proper sense of common sense and quickly agreed.
"If I get permission from Amasawa-san, I'll send a message."
"Please do. I'll be ready to move in the morning."
Amasawa was not the type to refuse a fight.
On the contrary, if these two wanted a rematch, she would be happy to accept.
She would understand that this camp was the perfect place with fewer surveillance eyes.
As Horikita nodded and was about to return to her room, I stopped her at the right timing.
"It's not related to the special training, but there's something I want you to investigate."
"What is it?"
If she was planning to propose a rematch, she could probably deceive Amasawa's sharp sense.
I made a small request to Horikita.
"I don't quite understand, but I just need to keep that in mind, right?"
"Yeah. Don't tell Amasawa."
"I understand. It's not a big deal."
I thanked Horikita, who readily agreed, and the meeting was adjourned.
"Well..."
I decided to look for Sakayanagi a little longer.
However, I wandered around the campsite aimlessly, but I didn't meet Sakayanagi.
Around 9 p.m., as the crowd began to thin, I decided to call it a day.
When I returned to my room, Hashimoto, Toyohashi, and Shintoku were preparing to go to the bath and were waiting for me, so I decided to go to the large bath with them.
2
After enjoying the bath at the large bathhouse for about an hour, I returned to the vicinity of my room with the three bath-goers.
Then, I saw the third-year student, >>>Tatebayashi<<<, standing in front of a room, looking displeased and fidgeting with his right foot. He seemed quite irritated.
"You finally came back..."
The gaze of >>>Tatebayashi<<< was not directed at us---but further back.
It was Kōenji, who had been doing as he pleased all day.
It was an expected result, but judging from >>>Tatebayashi<<<'s behavior, he hadn't been able to make contact even at this time. He didn't care about the irritated senpai and went to the front of the room.
"Could you move? You're in the way."
"What the hell are you---"
Before the lecture began, Kōenji pushed >>>Tatebayashi<<<'s shoulder and entered the room.
It wasn't that he had forced his way in, but rather that he had overpowered him with his superior physique and strength.

Rumors about Kōenji should have spread enough during the third year, but if you don't have any actual experience, you just feel angry. Without even trying to close the open door, >>>Tatebayashi<<< followed Kōenji who disappeared into the room.
"Hey, is it going to be a fight?"
First-year Shintoku looked at Hashimoto for instructions on what to do.
"Really, Kōenji is a handful. Should we just watch for now?"
If the door had been closed, they could have ignored it, but it was left wide open.
Everyone casually peeked inside.
Kōenji, who had entered the shared room, was already on the futon at the far end.
Three first-years and... it seems that all the second-years except Kōenji are out.
He started stretching as if he didn't recognize >>>Tatebayashi<<< who was standing and looking down.
I wonder what feelings Shintoku and Toyohashi had when they saw this.
"I don't want to get involved with Kōenjisenpai..."
"Same here..."
Without thinking, they said such things and were disgusted.
"What have you been doing until now!"
>>>Tatebayashi<<<, who has a reputation as a leader, questioned him.
"Me? It's obvious, isn't it? I'm polishing myself."
"Huh? Polishing yourself? Don't talk nonsense!"
No matter how loud he shouted, it wouldn't resonate with Kōenji.
"Cooperate properly tomorrow! We're on the edge here!"
"That's an impossible request."
Kōenji answered without looking at >>>Tatebayashi<<< at all.
The eyes of the first-year students peeking in at Kōenji were beginning to turn cold.
It's hard to adapt to this guy in a short period of time.
The kōhai in the same room also seemed to be unable to move and were just silent, but the atmosphere was heavy.
"Impossible request, do you think it's about the group!"
Tatebayashi continued to attack without giving up.
Without caring about his group mates, Kōenji turned over the futon on the spot.
"Then I'll sleep at the end."
"Don't decide on your own! It's decided that I'll decide where to sleep!"
When Hashimoto quietly entered the room, he asked the first-year students in the same room to stop Tatebayashi.
He quickly stood up and rushed to Tatebayashi's side, trying to calm him down with soothing words.
Tatebayashi, who was breathing with both shoulders, noticed the presence of the kōhai and regained a little calmness.
"Okay? You must obey the leader's instructions, right?"
But---
"I refuse. I hate going through unnecessary steps. Can you be quiet now?"
That was the last straw.
Tatebayashi, who had been comforting the kōhai, pushed them aside and shouted.
"It's not that I hate it!! There are first-years here too, I can't set an example as a senpai!!"
"Don't you know the saying, 'Buy hardships when you're young'? At times like this, young people should take the lead and give the better place to their seniors."
"Ah, yes, that's right. Don't worry about us... yes."
If a second-year student tells them to give way, most first-year students have no choice but to obey.
"Then I, a third-year, will order you. Buy hardships!"
"Come on, senpai, calm down."
Hashimoto stopped Tatebayashi, who was about to raise his fist in anger, by putting his arm around him.
Then he looked at us and appealed to us to return to the room first.
"Let's go back."
"But, is it okay?"
"Hashimoto should be able to handle this situation."

Leaving Hashimoto behind, we returned to our shared room.
It was about 10 minutes later that Hashimoto returned to the restless first-year students.
"Was everything okay?"
"He calmed down. It seems he was desperate because he really wanted to win."
Class D of the third year had little money to spend freely due to the tribute to Nagumo and the low class points. Because the rest of their school life was just a little bit, they seemed to want even a little pocket money.
"Nagumo-senpai and the others took most of the good students to the upper class, so they didn't have much leeway. So they took Kōenji from the leftovers and aimed for a one-shot reversal, and that's what happened."
If he could have handled it himself, he might have been able to move it. It's no wonder he was angry if such faint hope was betrayed.
"It must be hard for Ayanokōji-senpai... having someone like that as a classmate."
I didn't think anything of it, but I gathered a little new respect from the first-year students.
"Well..."
From here, we started preparing for bed, but there was still a problem that Hashimoto hadn't solved.
That was who would sleep where.
Like Kōenji and Tatelin had been arguing, it was a trivial but unavoidable part.
I remember that when students sleep together, there is often a fuss about where to sleep.
Especially on school trips, it was a big deal when Ryūen and Kitō had a pillow fight.
"Let's decide the game fairly here. To avoid something like Kōenji, right?"
Hashimoto volunteered to take on the unpleasant role.
"No, we really don't mind where. Right?"
"Yes. If anything, Ayanokōji-senpai can decide next!"
"No, no, why Ayanokōji? Can I be rude?"
Hashimoto retorted with a bitter smile.
"It's not like that... Ayanokōji-senpai is our aspiration!"
"Me too, Ayanokōji-senpai! I respect you!"
Shintoku and Toyohashi, with their eyes shining, revered me.
"...You seem to be admired in a short time."
"Well, even if you say that..."
I was the one who was most confused.
Until just a moment ago, there was no such thing.
Shintoku and Toyohashi, who had changed their attitudes drastically, were just tilting their heads, as were Kobayakawa and Yanagi, the same first-year students.
〇A strange sense of discomfort
The morning of the second day.
The time was still before 6 a.m.
It was getting a little brighter, but it was hard to say that the visibility was sufficient.
I moved a little away from the building to avoid being seen.
Even if I didn't worry, there wouldn't be many people who would come out at this time.
Soon, as promised, Horikita and Ibuki appeared.
"Yawn... I'm sleepy. And it's cold."
Ibuki yawned and stretched, shivering.
"If you don't like it, you can go back to your room without hesitation."
"You're kidding. I can't let you get your revenge on your own."
Rather than against Amasawa, it seemed that the main driving force was not wanting to let Horikita have her way.
"It seems she was happy to accept the rematch."
"Yes. She agreed immediately. But I faced resistance in an unexpected place."
"Unexpected place?"
"I asked for the morning of the fourth day as promised with you, but she negotiated to change it to the morning of the third day."
"She wanted to move it up a day earlier."
"Of course, since the condition for you to cooperate was the morning of the fourth day, I told her I couldn't compromise. In the end, she gave in, but she didn't seem to have improved her inconvenience. I wonder if she had some plans."
"In the early morning? It's hard to say. Since she accepted it, isn't it okay not to worry about it?"

If you hate getting up early, there's not much difference between the third and fourth day.
"Since I'm the one asking, I didn't ask too much about it because it's a private matter. There might be some problems unique to girls, so if you agree, could you get permission to change to the third day?"
Indeed, there is a cycle that could potentially be disadvantageous for women due to their physical structure.
But that's the same for Horikita and Ibuki, and I don't think Amasawa would use that as an excuse.
"If the other party has agreed despite the inconvenience, we should proceed as planned. We should not reduce the number of special training sessions."
"You're relentless."
"The morning of the fourth day is the decisive day. If you can't follow that, I can't accompany you in the special training."
"...I understand. I feel a bit guilty, but let's stick with the current plan. Is that okay?"
"Don't think about holding back out of consideration for the other party."
Horikita seemed to be troubled by something.
"I understand. She probably doesn't think she's going to lose at all. She's even worried about me."
She didn't seem to like that, but there was nothing she could do about it since she was on the revenge side.
"I'm going to beat her to a pulp."
Ibuki was fanning the flames of revenge next to me.
It's up to the individual to fan the flames, but going too far could be a big problem.
"Don't hurt her face, okay? It's a hassle if a fight gets out."
"Huh? If it's a weak point, I'll aim for it anywhere. Actually, the first thing I should do is kick Amasawa in the face, right?"
Even if I warn her here, she's likely to kick in mercilessly in the actual event.
"It's good that you're motivated."
For now, I decided to leave it at that, as she was showing a positive attitude.
"Can you tell me the additional conditions you're willing to accept right away?"
"Yeah. There's only one more condition left. Promise to fight 2 against 1 without hesitation if you judge it's difficult to win."
When I conveyed what I had decided in advance, neither Horikita nor Ibuki seemed to be able to swallow it immediately.
"I'm sorry. What do you mean by 2 against 1---"
"Of course, Horikita and Ibuki are the 2. If you can't swallow that, I'm not willing to cooperate."
When I told her again, Ibuki kicked the ground and thrust her fist at me.
"Huh!? What's this 2 against 1 in a revenge match? That's so lame. It's impossible."
"I'm not saying you shouldn't do 1 on 1. I said if you judge it's difficult, didn't I?"
"It sounds like you're denying the chance of winning."
"I'd like to sugarcoat it, but yeah, that's about it. I'm sorry, but the chances of beating Amasawa 1 on 1 are almost zero. I'm not going to go along with something that's just a waste of time."
Honestly, even if we manage to make it 2 against 1, there's a higher chance of it turning out like last time.
"I don't like it. I can't accept that condition."
"I don't like it either. But from the way you talk, it seems you know exactly how strong Amasawa-san is, don't you?"
"That's right. To be honest, it's not exactly a match, but I've seen her strength."
"...And you think there's that much of a gap between us and her?"
When I nodded, Ibuki seemed to be even more upset and looked away with a click of her tongue.
"I can't do this. I don't need Ayanokōji's help, I'll do it alone. In fact, Horikita should do the same."
"Indeed... you've put forward an unexpectedly hard-to-swallow condition."
She must have been planning to accept most things without hesitation before coming here.
It's no wonder she's wavering now, but pointless special training is meaningless.
"If that's the case, that's fine. It's easier for me if I don't have to cooperate."
"Let me ask you again. You understand Amasawa-san's strength, don't you?"
"I think I understand it better than you or Ibuki, at least. Although it's only for reference, I can also fight by estimating Amasawa's strength."
Horikita probably just wanted a simple match, but if she could fight against an opponent of similar strength, she couldn't help but feel attracted.
"---I understand. I'm fine with that condition. But what if Ibuki-san refuses?"
"This conversation is over. The possibility only arises if the two of you cooperate."
"Will you judge after seeing my improved strength?"
"That's right. Let's give it a try then."

I slowly dragged my foot and drew a small circle with it, about a meter in diameter. Then I stood in the center of the circle, my left hand forward and my right hand behind me.
"I won't move from here. And I'll only attack with my left hand."
"Huh?"
"If you can make me struggle in this state, you should be able to put up a good fight against Amasawa."
"Are you underestimating me?"
"You're free to interpret it as you wish, but you're the one who asked me to show you, right?"
"Funny. Well, I'll burn that arrogance to ashes first."
What an interesting way to put it.
Ibuki, like the last time we faced off, attacked mainly with kicks.
Her sharpness might have improved, but honestly, it was a negligible difference.
I quickly determined the direction of her foot and dodged.
"How cheeky! If I can grab your left arm, it's my game!"
Apparently, Ibuki intended to grab my left arm and seal my attack.
If that's what she wanted, I'd let her grab it to her heart's content.
When I deliberately held my left hand in an easy-to-reach position, she seized the opportunity and grabbed my left wrist. Immediately after, I opened my left hand's five fingers and took a big step with my left foot to the outside of Ibuki.
I detached the grabbed hand by drawing an arc from left to right while opening my left foot and escaping.
Ibuki, who was brushed off, was left in a defenseless state with her back fully exposed in front of me, if she realized it.
"Eh---!?"
I thrust my clenched left fist into Ibuki's back, which couldn't catch up with the understanding, and lightly tapped it.
"W-Why...!?"
"It's a kind of Aikido. The result won't change no matter how many times I do it."
In a one-on-one fight, the difference in ability cannot be overturned no matter how many times you fight.
To overturn it, you need to accept a two-on-one and exceed the number of moves of your opponent.
"Could you switch with me, Ibuki-san?"
"Don't you understand unless you experience it?"
"That's not it. Even with the short exchange just now, I could fully recognize your scariness. That's why I want Ibuki-san to see it objectively. There's no progress if you don't know what happened."
She seemed to want to let Ibuki gain experience voluntarily.
"I'll also seal your left hand in the same way. But I don't intend to let it happen the same way."
"That's better. It's stupid to come and get done in the same way on purpose."
I let Ibuki step back and now Horikita stood in front of me.
"You can start anytime."
"I intend to."
I thought she might take a breath, but she didn't seem to and started moving immediately.
And she quickly tried to grab not my left wrist but further ahead.
She seemed to want to try instinctively before complaining.
However, by skillfully adjusting on my end and pulling my arm, I forced her to grab my wrist.
"Kuh...!"
She didn't grab, she was grabbed. Even if Horikita recognized that in her consciousness, she had already started the motion and couldn't stop halfway. Even though she understood in her head that it was a disadvantageous position, she was moved in exactly the same way as Ibuki.
Instead of letting her grab where she aimed, I forced her to grab where she didn't want to.
The human mind is a strange thing, and even if you know you shouldn't grab, your brain decides it's better than not grabbing.
It's because she hasn't accumulated the experience that not grabbing can turn the situation to her advantage.
"So the pattern I was caught in was the same as now..."
"That's right."
"...I intended not to let it happen the same way, but before I knew it, I was forcibly taken..."
While oozing frustration, Horikita's eyes stared at me powerfully.
"This is the difference in ability between us and Amasawa-san right now, isn't it?"
"Yeah. At least unless you can make me break the rules I set for myself, I can't see any chance of winning."

Whether to drive her out of the circle or let her use her right arm.
Challenging for revenge without achieving either of those would only be laughed at.
"Are you convinced now? How reckless it is to fight Amasawa one-on-one?"
Horikita was still keeping her expression in check, but Ibuki was clearly showing her frustration.
Let's assume that she has stopped boasting about defeating her and has made some progress in understanding.
"How much is it..."
"What do you mean?"
"The difference between me and Amasawa. Can't you tell me in a more understandable way, like with numbers?"
Indeed, just vaguely feeling it might not be enough to maintain motivation in the future.
"If we talk about physical ability, if we treat Horikita and Ibuki as equal and give them a score of 50, Amasawa would be 60, a difference of about 10"
When I answered like that, both of them looked at each other, perhaps surprised that the difference was less than they thought.
"However, if we include technical skills, it's a different story. Horikita and Ibuki focus on one point of martial arts, while Amasawa has a much larger number of them. Taking that into account, the difference becomes even bigger"
I used numbers as a rough expression, but this is just a guideline.
The outcome can change due to the condition of the day, unpredictable events, misreading, and luck. But the greater the skill difference, the more trials will be needed.
"From now on, you two will fight her at the same time"
"I don't like it"
"I agree with you, Ibuki-san. But you understand why it's necessary, don't you?"
"I'll definitely make her use both hands. Okay?"
"I wonder about that. I think it's easier to drive her out of the circle, don't you?"
"I don't care, you should adjust to me"
They started arguing about how to fight before they even started.
Horikita and Ibuki are like oil and water. They probably didn't have any intention of cooperating from the start.
For now, I'll let them do as they please without mentioning it.
"We can't adjust to each other. Fine, let's attack as we please"
"I agree"
It seems they're not going to compromise, but rather attack at the same time, each doing their own thing.

"Shall we stop here?"
Both of them are greatly exhausted, partly because they are forced to play in an unfamiliar combination. When I called it a day, they both sat down at about the same time.
"Even if we do this for another day, it won't make much difference, but it should be somewhat better"
If they had challenged Amasawa for revenge without receiving any guidance, they wouldn't have been able to have any hope.
"How did you become so strong...?"
"I've been learning martial arts since I was little. That's all there is to it"
"I've been doing the same. I've been trying not to lose to those around me, with karate as my main focus"
Maybe I was a little too harsh. Did I damage her confidence, which is backed by Horikita's experience?
I was thinking of inserting some mental care in a hurry, but it seems that there is no need to worry about that.
"But I've decided to think of you as an exception. The fact that my brother recognized you is now a support for me"
"Hmm..."
Unlike Horikita, Ibuki, still grumbling, stood up and turned her back.
"I'll definitely make her use both hands tomorrow"
Leaving those words behind, she stomped on the ground and returned to the camp.
"She's really a sore loser"
It's not a bad thing, but it's a shame that her vision is narrowed because of it.
I'm not sure if she was able to absorb all the moves and fighting styles.
"It's okay. I'll have a hearing with her later and review today's experience. Even if I have to force her"
That's reassuring.
I walked back to the camp with Horikita.
"I didn't think you would cooperate so much. I thought you would hold back more, or stay within a safe range..."

There were several reasons stacked up, but the core factor for not revealing too much of my hand was because I had judged it to be too harsh for the future Horikita.
"Sometimes I do charity work."
"It's suspicious. I can't help but suspect there's something behind it."
"There's no choice but to be prepared at that time."
When I conveyed this with a deliberate implication, Horikita narrowed her eyes in disbelief.
"Right. Let's give and take with each other."
After accepting it in such a way, I parted ways with Horikita in front of the building and decided to return to my room separately.
It would be better if Amasawa didn't know that I was guiding.
And by the time I returned to my shared room, it was just before 7 o'clock.
It was just when Hashimoto was waking up and raising his upper body.
As we were quietly conversing, the first-year students were also awakened from their shallow sleep, and soon all the residents of the shared room woke up.
"Alright. Then I'll go to the morning bath. What about you guys?"
I decided to join Hashimoto and enjoy the morning bath.
"Oh, is Ayanokōjisenpai going too!?"
"That's the plan---"
"Yanagi and Kobayashi, Kozumi, let's go too!"
"Huh? No, we..."
"Just come! Ayanokōjisenpai is calling!"
No, I'm not calling at all.
I would appreciate it if you didn't say anything that could be misunderstood as power harassment.
2
After finishing the morning bath, our Kiryūin group, at Hashimoto's command, gathered all the remaining members, including the girls.
Then, during breakfast, we exchanged opinions about today's exchange meeting.
That being said, more than half of the conversation was Hashimoto's talk, and the rest was a little bit from the other students.
"I don't really understand, but the unusual excitement of the boys... it's creepy."
Morishita, who was whispering next to me, spewed venom.
"Really? I thought it was kind of cute."
Hiyori's remark seemed to neutralize it.
Hearing the conflicting evaluation of being cute, Morishita stared at the first-year boys again.
Regardless of whether they are cute or not, it is certain that they are unusually excited. They were mostly shrinking in front of the senpais when they gathered as a group yesterday, but that has completely disappeared.
Rather, they are making incomprehensible gestures with their hands and even bursting into laughter.
"Is it cute?"
"I think it's cute."
"I'm sorry, but it's still creepy. Shiina Hiyori is strange."
"Is that so?"
Watching such an exchange nearby, I feel that Hiyori has changed a lot since we met.
She used to be a student who didn't show her heart and had little emotional ups and downs.
No, rather than saying that her personality has changed from the bottom up, it might be more accurate to say that she has started to expose her true self.
"Ayanokōji-kun. Is something wrong?"
Because I was observing without hesitation, Hiyori noticed my gaze.
"It's nothing. Don't worry about it."
"Is that so?" She tilted her head slightly but showed a smile without suspecting anything.
"Ayanokōjisenpai! Can I join you in the bath again tonight!?"
"Huh? Oh, I don't mind at all."
While feeling a strange pressure, I agreed because it wasn't a bother.
Then, just with that, the first-year students bubbled up again.
"In less than a day, you've tamed the first-year students so well. What kind of magic did you use?"
Kiryūin, who had finished her meal a step ahead, leaned on the table and muttered with interest.

"Honestly, I'm also confused. I haven't done anything special."
"Do you intend to hide it from me too?"
It seemed that he thought I was keeping a secret, but in reality, I didn't understand.
"Do you not understand why you're garnering respect from your kōhai?"
Hashimoto, who had been eavesdropping on our conversation, chimed in.
"I might not understand it myself, but there's a part of me that admires you--- or rather, fears you."
"Fears?"
Fear is the feeling of terror towards something with overwhelming power.
Unfortunately, I don't remember using any form of intimidation like Ryūen or Hōsen...
"I was surprised too, you're really a man's man... It's not surprising that the first years would act this way once they found out about that."
"Huh? I don't quite understand, but it's very interesting. What is 'that'?"
"No, it's a secret between men. I can't tell you, sorry."
"Hmm. A secret between men, that's not so bad."
For some reason, Kiryūin seemed satisfied with that explanation and stood up from his chair.
As he was about to pick up his empty tray, Hashimoto stopped him.
"We'll clean up, you don't have to worry about it, senpai."
"I appreciate the thought, but I can clean up after myself. Let's meet again at the next mixer."
With that, he picked up his tray and walked towards the return counter.
"Whether it's easy or hard to deal with, he's a difficult senpai to understand."
Hashimoto voiced his thoughts on the departing Kiryūin.
In terms of being selective, he was right.

"Good morning, Ayanokōji-kun."
After finishing my meal and passing through the lobby, I found Sakayanagi sitting alone on a sofa.
"Good morning. You look a bit sleepy."
She seemed a bit out of it, so I asked her about it. She nodded without denying it.
"Yes. It seems I'm not good with sharing a room, I couldn't sleep well. I decided to take a short break after a light meal."
Even if she wasn't exactly dozing off, closing her eyes might have some effect.
"I see. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to relax even if you return to your shared room."
"Usually, I get eight hours of sleep a day. It seems I'll struggle for a few days."
Considering her personality, it's possible that she sleeps exactly eight hours.
"Did you get along with your group members?"
"I don't think there's a need to get used to them, but I'm in charge of Class A. Without me doing anything, they approach me, so I'm not having trouble with conversations."
It seemed she wasn't having any problems in that regard, so that was good.
"How about you? Are you having any problems with sharing a room with unfamiliar people?"
"Well, they're letting me have a good time."
"Ayanokōji-kun, you're in the same group as Hashimoto-kun and Morishita-san. How is Hashimoto-kun doing?"
"He's acting as usual, but he seemed to be scared of something."
"Speaking of him, there's a strange rumor going around. Something about him betraying the class. I'd appreciate it if you could warn me to be careful."
"I don't think a warning would help."
"Hehe."
Sakayanagi laughed a little, but she didn't seem as confident or relaxed as usual.
"Are you getting along with your group?"
"This isn't a special exam, just a mixer, so I'm not doing anything special."
"That's a bit different from the information I got. Hashimoto said you'd aim to win in any way."
"You're not usually one to take things at face value, Ayanokōji-kun. It's probably just one of the excuses he used to scout me."
Hashimoto's statement might have been a bit exaggerated, but it wasn't completely off the mark.
"Certainly, right after Masumi-san left, there was unexpected damage. You know that too, Ayanokōji-kun. But, I won't dwell on it for long."

Sakayanagi answered with such composure.
"If there's a reason why I didn't do anything at this exchange meeting, it might be because I'm focusing on identifying someone who can become my new hands and feet."
Indeed, Kamuro had been a significant presence as a caretaker until now.
It was certain that her absence would make it difficult to move.
"The person I keep close to me must be someone I can trust as much as possible."
"What about Kitō?"
"He is one of the most loyal in the class, but there is a resistance to the opposite sex. Even if I choose from among the girls, there is no suitable candidate at the moment."
The only girls in Class A that I interact with are Yamamura and Morishita. Both of them have their strengths, but they are not suitable for taking care of Sakayanagi.
"Have you decided on a successor?"
"Not yet. So I expect to be acting alone for a while. I am prepared to accept this as a result of my own misjudgment."
It seemed more like she wasn't seriously looking for a replacement than she couldn't find one.
It might be an exaggeration to call it a penance for Kamuro, but she seemed to be choosing to live a life of inconvenience for a while.
That was also Sakayanagi's choice, but there was another problem that needed to be resolved.
Suddenly, I felt a presence behind me and turned around to see Kitō approaching with a scary (as usual?) look on his face.
"Good morning."
"...There seems to be no problem."
Ignoring my greeting, Kitō spoke those words to Sakayanagi.
"There is no problem at all. Thank you for your concern."
Watching their exchange, I understood that Kitō had approached out of concern for Sakayanagi.
It was not unreasonable to be sensitive to contact from foreign bodies from other classes, not just Hashimoto, at a time when she was unstable after losing Kamuro.
"Don't take it the wrong way, Ayanokōji-kun."
"I understand. It's probably best to be suspicious right now."
"Good morning!"
As I was confronting Sakayanagi and Kitō, Amasawa slid into the gap between us.
"Good morning, Amasawa-san. You seem to be in good spirits this morning."
"Being energetic is one of my strengths, you know."
Kitō stepped back from Sakayanagi a bit, but kept his mouth shut so as not to interrupt the conversation.
"I thought I'd give you a little encouragement before the second day of the exchange meeting starts. It seems like Ayanokōjisenpai has been winning all along, but... Arisusenpai lost three times on the first day. I'm worried that you might be in a pinch already."
"Unfortunately, I am not involved in any of the command this time. I have left it all to the third graders."
"Hmm? So if you lose, it can't be helped? I was hoping for a little bit of interaction with other grades this time, as it's a valuable opportunity."
"There's no need to impose restrictions within constraints. If you wish to challenge me, I am always ready to accept, so please rest assured."
Ignoring the exchange meeting, Sakayanagi conveyed that she was ready to take on any challenge at any time.
However, upon hearing this, Amasawa laughed it off instead of getting excited.
"You're bluffing. I've heard that you lost in the previous special exam and ended up at the bottom."
She seemed to have thoroughly collected information about the second-year students and confronted Sakayanagi without hesitation.
And then, the moment Amasawa tried to touch Sakayanagi as if to tease her, Kitō grabbed her wrist mercilessly, demonstrating his role as a shield.
"What are you doing, Kitōsenpai? Isn't this something you should do to Ryūensenpai or someone?"
She portrayed herself as a weak woman, but Kitō did not loosen his grip.
"Whether it's Ryūen or anyone else, I'll act if necessary. Of course, I won't choose the means to do so. Remember that, Satoru-shi."
Against Amasawa, who was smiling but showing hostility, Kitō made such a statement.
"You're like a knight protecting a princess, but it's interesting. I don't mind if you're violent even against a girl... Maybe I went too far with my joke."
Amasawa apologized, indicating that she had no real intention of doing anything. As soon as Kitō loosened his grip, she backed away.
"I'll play with you again next time. Please be ready to give it your all, Arisu-senpai!"
Amasawa hopped away, turning around and waving her hand several times.
"The calm atmosphere has been ruined."
"Maybe so."
After a little bit of such an exchange, I decided to leave.

I didn't want to draw unnecessary attention to Sakayanagi by hanging around too much.
〇The Watcher and the Watched
The second day of the exchange meeting began at 9 am.
Today and tomorrow, students who were ordered to participate in many games by the leader would have a little more busy time as they had to complete seven games each day.
However, what they had to do was no different from the previous day.
When the time came, they followed the instructions that were delivered, met up with the opposing group, and played the game.
On the other hand, those who did not participate were free to do whatever they wanted during their free time.
Students with a high chance of ranking high should probably just go through the experiential learning and make sure to collect the stamps to receive the reward.
The sixth game was 'Sculpture Experience'.
It was a full-fledged experience where you could use a professional tool to carve a stone, which was obviously different from what you would do in a school art class. It was a truly exciting experiential learning.
For me, who was determined to participate in all the games, I didn't have much time to have a free experience. So, I still had a lot of unexperienced learning left.
If I could, I would like to stay here for a week or two, not just these three days.
I was lost in thought as I looked at the uncarved stones and tools prepared for the students.
However, the two groups that had gathered were not interested in the raw stones of the works that were full of charm, but were busy chatting about this and that.
For ordinary students, this experiential learning is just a part of their school life...
Well, it's easier for us to do it if it's a bit more relaxed, right?
If a specific person continues to participate in the game in a row, it would seem to stand out a bit, but it doesn't attract attention at all. This is because experiential learning is always taking place here and there, and the school does not disclose information such as who the participants of each group were. Since there are no students who are eager to gather information, no one cares whether I win or lose. Even if I participate in all 19 games, the only ones who would know this fact would probably be the Nagumo group, who never miss a chance to scout individual performances.
"It seems that Ayanokōji-kun's group had a good start with five consecutive wins yesterday."
Kushida, who was assigned to the first opposing group of the day, approached me and spoke to me.
"It seems that the first-year students are doing their best. You also have four wins, so it seems you're doing well."
I had found out that the only game they lost was against the Nagumo group, who are the top contenders for the championship.
"We decided not to worry about winning or losing. But that's because we decided to do our best and enjoy ourselves. But everyone just wants to take it easy and keeps asking me for favors. This is my sixth consecutive participation."
After saying that, she revealed her true feelings without breaking her smile.
"It's really stupid. Experiential learning is so lame. I wish this training camp would end soon."
"What you say and what you do are completely opposite."
It's impressive that she can spit venom without moving her facial muscles much.
"I just do it because I don't want to lose out if I don't make a good face. Honestly, I think we don't need to take this exchange meeting seriously. There are people's eyes everywhere, in the shared room, in the large bath, at meals, and I don't have time to relax."
She seems to want to be sent home as soon as possible, not needing any rewards or anything.
It seems that she feels extreme stress from having to act like a good girl in an environment that is smaller than school.
"Don't let the stress build up and explode."
"I think I'm okay for now. Lately, I've been able to let off steam by dealing with those two."
It goes without saying that "those two" refers to Horikita and Ibuki.
"It seems you lost to that Horikita group."
"Maybe it's the result of their serious efforts to do various things with a straight face, since being overly serious is their only merit? Yesterday, Katsuragi-kun seemed to be immersed in practicing glass crafts because he couldn't do it well, and he lined up many times."
In the case of experiential learning in manufacturing, a large number of people cannot participate at once due to the number of instructors, equipment, and other problems. If it overlaps with the game time of the exchange meeting, they can hardly use the free participation slots, and inevitably a waiting line is formed.
"Nagumo is determined to win, and his members are serious, so he won't hold back."
"Do you think they will win as expected?"
"If we don't take action, there's a high chance of that."
When I answered that, Kushida asked back with a curious look.
"But, even if you say 'take action', all we can do is practice and hope that the game we can perform well in is chosen, right? Maybe the leader can choose the right person, but..."
"There are various other ways to increase our winning percentage in order to become a championship candidate. For example, we can buy off the opposing group and have them give us the win. If we ask with a certain amount of money and sincerity, there should be plenty of room for negotiation, right?"
Of course, efficiency is another matter.
It's just one example of a way to increase the winning percentage.
Kushida imagines a scene where she is approached by an opponent for consultation.
"Indeed, if they give me 10,000 points, I have less reason to refuse, and I would be happy to give them the win. But if I keep doing that, won't I be in the red?"
Of course, it depends on how much you negotiate with whom. If you give 10,000 points to five opponents, it will be 50,000 points, but you can also use a bribe to the leader to settle it for 20,000 or 30,000 points.
However, the reason why such a strategy is unlikely to spread is that there is little incentive in this exchange meeting.
Even if the Kiryūin group could win 16 or 17 games in a row by repeatedly buying off their opponents, groups like Nagumo, who are determined to win the championship, would naturally not agree to be bought off, and they would have to clash head-on. As a result, if they end up in second or third place, they may not even be able to recover the money they used for the buyout.

"So that's why no one does it. It's not profitable."
The only one who wanted the title of champion regardless of profit and loss was probably Nagumo.
"Is there a way to do it without spending money?"
"It requires effort and isn't flashy, but there's also a method of sealing off some experiential learning and not letting rivals practice. Popular experiential learning, as Kushida said, forms a line."
Surrounding the students of the rival group and repeatedly delaying them was also effective.
"It sounds like something Ryūen-kun would happily use."
"Yeah, but the reason there's no such movement at the moment is because it causes the same problems as buying out."
"So it's not worth it, it doesn't match up, right?"
"That's right."
An instructor in overalls appeared and instructed the students to gather once.
"I'm rooting for your group, by the way. I'd be happy if you could give Horikita-san a loss."
Even though we've become friendly(?), Ibuki still wants Horikita to lose.
That's probably why the relationship between the three of us is miraculously balanced.
"Does that mean you're going to give us the win in this game?"
"I wonder about that."
She had a cute smile on her face, but she didn't seem to be going easy on us.
Furthermore, the result of the game with Kushida's group was a 3-2 victory for our group.
Thanks to my passion for artistic activities, which other students didn't have, I was able to win.
After that, the games of the exchange meeting continued solemnly without any flashy movements, both in the morning and in the afternoon.
'Trump'
In the seventh game from the first day, it was the first battle where luck played a big part. As a result of the game, including me, the whole group suffered a spectacular defeat and recorded our first loss. With this, we only had one more game we could afford to lose, but the trump card brought quite a bit of excitement to the modest exchange meeting, and more students were enjoying it much more than the six games we had played so far.
'Chalk Art'
Drawing pictures on a reasonably sized blackboard with chalk. The fact that we were not drawing original works but copying made it surprisingly easy to challenge. Chalk was a bit different from colored pencils and crayons, which we usually use to decorate with color.
While I struggled with the unique texture, it was also a moment when I touched a new world of art.
As a result of competing for the quality of the copies, I was able to win in the individual competition and as a group, we were able to win 3-2.
'Putter Golf'
From the indoor exchange meeting in the morning, we went outside for a golf experience on a small course.
Before the start, there were many male volunteers, and the leader's choice, taking that into consideration, led to a slightly unusual situation where all the participants were male. Furthermore, everyone was inexperienced in this game. Whether this comparison of acorns worked in reverse or not, the game was as exciting as the trump card or more. Although I won in the individual competition, the other four lost by a small margin, resulting in our second group loss.
'Patchwork'
It's a word you might not hear often. Patchwork is a type of handicraft where small pieces of cloth are connected to make a large sheet. How much can be completed within the time limit, and the design, etc., are evaluated. The opponent who appeared here was the Tatebayashi group, which had a dispute on the first day due to Kōenji's selfish behavior. Their record so far was 1 win and 9 losses.
All five participants were girls and experienced sewers, a formidable enemy. Moreover, the misfortune of colliding with Inogashira, who excelled among the experienced sewers, resulted in my second individual loss. The group also suffered its third loss.
'Archery'
The 11th game, where we wanted to avoid consecutive losses, was another outdoor sport.
Even if you haven't done it before, you can probably imagine the rules. We competed in a game called Rika-erb, where we aim at a target one-on-one. Normally in Rika-erb, you shoot an arrow at a target 70 meters away, but in this experiential learning, it was set at 20 meters. Each person was given six arrows, and the total points were competed for. The center of the target was 10 points and the outermost part was 1 point.
Morishita, who volunteered to participate, entered the game, but was unable to handle it well and couldn't hit the target even once, a slight accident, but both the group and the individual were successful in avoiding consecutive losses.
'Glasswork'
The last game of the second day was glasswork. This facility had a large workshop prepared, and the items made could be taken home, making it a popular experiential learning among the students. The opponent didn't care much about winning and had a low winning rate, and each person made what they wanted to make, so I was able to win in the judgment for the individual competition in terms of completion and production speed.
On the other hand, in the group competition, Hiyori showed her skill again and contributed to the win.
At the end of the second day, which was the middle of the competition, the total group results of the exchange meeting were 12 games, 9 wins, and 3 losses.

Just before 6 p.m., a time to relax after the exchange meeting.
The rest area inside the building was a bit crowded.
This was because a free drink corner had been set up to comfort the tired students. There were several types of tea and juice, and small paper cups were stacked upside down in a row.
"Your group seems to be doing quite well."
I ran into Sanada, who had stopped by the rest area at almost the same time, and he said to me.
The Kiryūin group was tied for sixth place with 9 wins and 3 losses.
Depending on the results of tomorrow, it's possible to aim for the podium.
"I'm being helped by reliable allies."

I clearly recognized that Hiyori was particularly good at detailed work.
Her ability to handle things like pressed flowers and glasswork, which require not only technical skills but also aesthetic sense, was far higher than that of an average student.
This was something I would never have noticed if I hadn't spent time with her in experiential learning.
"How are the students in class A? Are they cooperating well?"
She asked hesitantly, seemingly concerned about her classmates.
"Hashimoto hasn't participated in the game yet. He's more of a support role. Yamamura is participating in the game, and he's honest, which is helpful."
However, Yamamura had seemed listless lately, but I didn't mention that.
As I talked about the good points of the two, Sanada listened with joy as if it were about herself.
"Then there's Morishita... well, cooperative... no, creative, I guess."
"Creative. That might be true."
Morishita, in contrast to Hiyori, was not dexterous with her hands, but rather clumsy.
I think she's trying hard, but she's not producing results. There might be something artistic about her ability to create bizarre things.
Even her volunteered archery was terrible.
While talking, the two of us lined up in a short line, and I took a paper cup and poured tea into it. Sanada seemed to have chosen hot coffee.
"I see. Honestly, I'm glad that the three of them are in the same group as Ayanokōji-kun this time."
There might be some elements of social courtesy in her words, but something about Sanada's statement bothered me.
"Why do you think so? There should be many other students who are closer to them."
Even if we limit it to Horikita's class, Yōsuke and Kushida are much more competent.
"Well, it's largely because of how Sakayanagi-san sees it. Even I can tell that she treats Ayanokōji-kun specially. After the last test, Kitō-kun has been on edge, but I think he's still able to control his self-restraint because Ayanokōji-kun is by Hashimoto-kun's side."
For Hashimoto, it's been a series of unexpected good luck since the day he came to my room.
"Are all three of them blending into the group? I think Hashimoto-kun will maneuver well, but I don't think Morishita-san and Yamamura-san will."
"I wonder. I'm honestly leaving the girls to the girls... Are you worried?"
Does she have some concerns about the two of them, or is she just worried about her classmates?
Both have distinctive personalities, so it wouldn't be surprising.
"Actually, I've been watching over Morishita-san quite a bit since our first year."
"If she heard that, she might cry."
"Eh, what? No, not at all. I'm only for >>>Miya<<<-san!"
Sanada, usually calm, hastily corrected herself.
Her reaction strongly conveyed her desire not to be misunderstood.
"Part of it is because our seats were close in the first year... She's the type to say everything she thinks and doesn't shy away from anything, so she's had her fair share of small troubles."
Indeed, she had recently made several remarks that had taken Hashimoto aback.
"She seems to be an outsider in the class."
"Yes... It's a bad way to put it, but she is perceived that way."
It's not like Ichinose's class where everyone is friendly. There are people you like and people you don't. It's normal to show it in your attitude.
"I'm not familiar with the situation, but Morishita doesn't care, does she?"
If Morishita enjoys being alone, it's not for others to say.
That's probably why Sanada said she had been watching over her.
"Yes, well. I've never seen her seem to care..."
"I don't think you need to worry so much. But I understand what you want to say, Sanada. I'll keep an eye on her for the day and a half we're in the group."
"...Yes. Thank you."
Sanada took a sip of the hot coffee she had poured into her cup, lightly cooling it with a sigh.
She seemed to finally be able to relax.
"Sanadasenpai!"
While we were resting shoulder to shoulder, a girl from class 1-B, Miya, spotted Sanada and ran over.
Realizing that I was talking to Sanada, she hastily bowed.
"I'll be in the way, so I'll go back to my room. See you later, Sanada."
"Yes, see you later."
They haven't been together for long, but they seem to be getting along very well.

They could always be together in the brass band club, and they must be spending fun student-like time together.
It would be wise to leave quickly before causing any unnecessary trouble.
2
After dinner, most of the students were relaxing in their rooms or baths.
Tokitō quietly left the shared room upon receiving a call from Ishizaki on his mobile.
In the group to which Tokitō belonged, Hōsen Kazuomi, the most problematic first-year student, was a member. However, Tokitō didn't see Hōsen's existence as a problem, and even criticized his arrogant attitude.
He was not exceptionally strong in fights, smart, or good at talking.
The only reason Tokitō could stand without fear was because of his rebellious spirit that he had maintained without breaking under Ryūen's control. It was undoubtedly thanks to two years of experience.
The area where the experiential classes gathered, their destination, was already deserted and quiet.
The place where Ishizaki called him was in front of the pottery class.
When he peered in through the window in the hallway, he saw a line of works made by the students.
The pottery and other items made here, like the glasswork experience, could be shipped to your home after they were fired if you wished, and among them was Tokitō's work, who had participated in 'painting' in the morning game.
"...You call someone and you're not here yet"
He was about to take out his mobile phone from his jersey pocket in irritation. That's when it happened.
"Hey, sorry to keep you waiting"
"What do you want, Ishizaki"
Tokitō, who was irritated by the leisurely approaching Ishizaki, called out to him, but Ishizaki came up to him without answering his question.
"Don't you know what I want?"
"How would I know... you didn't write anything specific"
The message he received was only suggestive of urgency, saying 'come quickly'.
"Well, I guess you wouldn't know. To be honest, I don't even know what I want"
It was a strange story that Ishizaki, who had called him, didn't know.
"You don't know? I don't understand at all---"
Just as he was about to voice his dissatisfaction, Tokitō felt a strong pressure on his back.
And immediately after, he realized that he had been forcefully pushed against the wall.
"Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing?"
A devil whispered in his ear with a laugh.
"Ryūen...!? What do you mean, what... what are you doing!"
Surprised, but managing to keep his composure to a minimum, he turned his gaze behind him.
"I thought you needed more discipline. So I made a surprise appearance"
Held down forcefully, Tokitō couldn't escape.
Even if he could break free from the restraint for a moment, he knew that Ishizaki, who was watching nearby, would come to help.
"I don't... understand..."
His arm was tightened to the limit and the pain crept up to his back.
"Do you really not understand?"
There was one thing he actually remembered, but he couldn't say it and played dumb.
"I didn't do anything..."
"Really? I've got a report from below about you"
"Wh, what? Wh, what is that!? What are you talking about!?"
He insisted that he didn't understand, but the palpitations in his chest from his impatience attacked Tokitō.
He hoped that what he had sensed had nothing to do with him, but that hope was shattered immediately after.
"Since coming to the training camp, I've received eyewitness reports that you've been trying to get along with Sakayanagi four times"
When the name Sakayanagi came up, Tokitō gave up on playing dumb.
"I just happened to meet her, and we just chatted. I don't understand what's wrong with that...!"
"It's a plausible reason, but unfortunately I can't believe it"
Considering the frequency of contact between people who are not in the same group, it's hard to excuse it as just a coincidence.
"And you don't know what's wrong? That's a funny story"
"Ugh..."

Tokitō averted his gaze, having his pretense seen through.
Ryūen pursued him, forcing eye contact by bringing his face closer.
"He's on the decline now. He'll fall and be done by the next end-of-year exam. That's why I told you not to intervene carelessly, didn't I?"
Ryūen had particularly warned Kondō and >>>Yajima<<<, who were in the same group as Sakayanagi when the groups were announced on the bus. There was no way Tokitō hadn't heard the warning in the silent bus.
"So a casual conversation... becomes an intervention?"
"It does not. And I should have said this too, right? Either ignore Sakayanagi or, if possible, inflict mental damage and corner her thoroughly. Can you interpret this as a fun chat, Ishizaki?"
"Absolutely not!"
"That's right, isn't it? You, who are smarter than this Ishizaki, should have understood."
In reality, Tokitō was the exact opposite.
Reports had come in that he was often seen caring for and supporting Sakayanagi, not just having casual conversations.
"You even told Isoyama, who saw you talking, to keep quiet, didn't you? You should have known which order to follow, mine or yours."
Ishizaki, who was listening nearby, nodded forcefully several times.
"Learn your lesson, Tokitō. It'll make things easier for you. Even Ryūen-san will forgive you."
If he pledged obedience here, he would at least be released from captivity.
But Tokitō bit his lip hard and glared at Ryūen while trying to shake him off.
"I... I just..."
"Just what?"
With no point in hiding anything anymore, and feeling foolish for trying, Tokitō spat out his words with a vexed emotion.
"I just wanted to comfort Sakayanagi, who was sad about her friend Manabu-shi leaving...!"
"Huh. So you want to sleep with Sakayanagi that badly?"
"No, that's not it! It's not like that!"
"Is that so? It sounds like that to me."
Ryūen, laughing, continued his words.
"Should I set up a stage for you to attack her then? Even that composed woman will be torn apart physically and mentally if you do her."
At such a devilish whisper, Tokitō's anger shot through the roof in an instant, and he broke free from Ryūen's restraint with more strength than usual.
"Don't mess with me!"
Driven by his raging emotions, he tried to grab Ryūen with both hands, but Ryūen's laughing figure disappeared from his sight. He received a kick flying up from below, gritted his teeth, and was restrained again.
"Hehehe, don't take it seriously. But if you're up for it, I could let you take on the role of cornering Sakayanagi."
"...I won't obey you... I'll never accept this way...!"
He refused to yield to the threat and seemed to have expressed his intention to continue treating Sakayanagi as before.
Understanding that his spirit and determination were genuine, Ryūen did not stop his harsh treatment.
"Then shall I make you understand with your body?"
"Don't mess with me, you can't---"
Before Tokitō could finish speaking, Ryūen clenched his left fist and rammed it into Tokitō's abdomen without hesitation.
"Ugh...!"
With an expression of agony from the unfamiliar intense pain, Tokitō's knees buckled.
But because he was being held by Ryūen, he was not allowed to sit on the ground.
"There are no school surveillance cameras here. Right, Ishizaki?"
"Yes! I've confirmed that there are none in this area!"
"To think you'd obey such a guy...!"
Tokitō spat venom, irritated by Ishizaki's attitude.
"I understand what you want to say, Tokitō. I've been rampaging with full control of the class, but I once gave up that position. You must have felt good then, right?"
"Yeah... I felt like I'd driven out the naked king...!"
At Tokitō's merciless comment, Ishizaki put his hand to his forehead, saying "Oh dear."
If you say something disrespectful, you'll be purged. That's the norm, and it's ingrained in his body.
But Ryūen, without adding physical pain, opened his eyes as if enjoying himself.
"That's too bad. After all, I'm back in my old seat and doing whatever I want. It must be frustrating."
He looked at himself objectively, and didn't need to think about how he was perceived by the lower classes.

That being said, Ryūen didn't change his attitude.
"Do you hate me?"
"I hate you... to death..."
"Then don't hold back. Show me you can take me down by force. I won't run or hide. But if you raise your fist, I'll corner you no matter what. The only way out is expulsion. Be prepared for that."
Everyone, not just Tokitō, understood well that Ryūen was not afraid of defeat.
That's why they had to only rebel when they were absolutely determined to defeat him.
"Got it? This is advice from me. If you understand, don't ever help Sakayanagi again."
Despite the pain in his tightened arm, he gently told him that he could still turn back.
"What if... I break... that promise...?"
Ryūen smiled with pleasure at Tokitō's question, which didn't need to be asked.
"I'll crush you. Simple as that."
The same would happen even if he didn't raise his fist.
He told him that he would relentlessly attack those who did not obey.
"...!"
Despite being threatened, Tokitō continued to glare at Ryūen without losing his rebellious spirit.
"That's good, Tokitō. I find that part of you interesting. So let's see how long you can keep that look in your eyes."
While looking down at his aching arm, he made up his mind immediately in a situation where he couldn't escape.
"You can rest assured that I won't let Ishizaki lay a hand on you."
Ryūen, who gave Tokitō the time to catch his breath and the right to strike first, took a step back and spread his arms.
"I'll do it... I won't lose... to someone like you..."
He reassured himself and rubbed his fists together.
There was a significant gap in their fighting strength.
But he was prepared to go all out and punch Ryūen in the face at least once.
If he was prepared for the backlash, he should be able to do it.
Just as he was about to firm up that determination, an unexpected person appeared.
"I came looking for the >>>senpai<<< I sent on an errand because he didn't come back, and what do I find here?"
The one who appeared on the scene, hand on his neck, was Hōsen from class 1-D.
He had a long-standing relationship with Ryūen since middle school.
"What's going on, Tokitō senpai?"
"...It's nothing..."
Although they were in the same group, Tokitō couldn't cry to his junior in the first year and answered like that.
But there was no way nothing was going on when he was confronting Ryūen with his fist clenched. He had pride as a senpai who couldn't cry to his junior, but this was a problem within the class. He thought he couldn't cause any disadvantage to the group because of this.
"Get lost. You're in the way."
Ryūen tried to shoo him away with a light wave of his hand, saying it would spoil the mood.
"If there's nothing going on, go buy us first-years some drinks right away."
Hōsen, for his part, ignored Ryūen and spoke to Tokitō in a strong tone.
"Huh? Drinks? What on earth...!"
Tokitō, who had been given the right to strike first, was dumbfounded and didn't use it, and Ryūen's arm reached out again. He pressed his left forearm against his throat and slammed him against the wall.
"Ugh...!?"
Tokitō let out a scream of agony, unable to fully voice his pain.
"Back off, Hōsen. I'm not dealing with you right now."
"I don't care about that. I'm talking to Tokitō senpai here. You're the outsider, so back off. Or do you want to die?"
"---Ha. You came all this way to look for me? Don't be so sleepy."
Ryūen suspected that someone was behind Hōsen.
"No, Hōsen has nothing to do with it... I just told Ishizaki to... call me here..."
"Huh? Hey Ishizaki. What kind of message did you send?"
"Huh!? It, it was just a normal one! I just told him to hurry to the experiential classroom area, that's all!"
Ishizaki's careless mistake of not considering the risk of telling where he was going when leaving the room.

Seeing Ryūen smirk slightly through his nose, Ishizaki realized he had made a mistake.
"Sorry, Ryūen-san! Hey, Hōsen, you go over there!"
Ishizaki tried to make amends by grabbing Hōsen's thick right arm, but he was easily shaken off.
"Don't touch me. I'll kill you."
"Uh...!"
Ishizaki flinched at Hōsen's intense intimidation, which was different from Ryūen's fear.
Instead of leaving, Hōsen started walking towards Ryūen and Tokitō.
"It seems he wants to play. Albert, you handle this guy."
Without making a sound, Albert appeared in front of Hōsen, blocking his way.
"As always, you can't do anything without relying on your underlings."
"Fighting isn't just about charging in alone like an idiot."
Hōsen yawned, then immediately spat phlegm on the floor.
"I've always wanted to fight you, Albert. It might be more fun than playing table tennis."
In the chaotic situation that didn't seem like a training camp, Ryūen shifted his gaze from Hōsen and looked directly at Tokitō.
"Now that the nuisance is gone, let's continue the fight---"
"Excuse me, but could you let go of your hand, Ryūen-senpai?"
"Huh?"
The person who spoke up to stop Ryūen, who was about to impose further punishment, was Utomiya Riku from Class 1-C.
"What, Utomiya, you came too?"
"What, what's going on?"
The only one who was disturbed was Ishizaki.
"Huh? Oh right, you were listening to Tokitō-senpai's story too."
"I came to see if you were going to raise your hand against senpai."
"Where are your eyes? There's no way I'm going to raise my hand."
Despite looking at Hōsen with contempt, Utomiya walked towards Tokitō and Ryūen.
Ishizaki tried to stop him, but he was pulled in by Hōsen's long arm, which was holding the sleeve of his jersey.
With no one to stop him, Utomiya fearlessly closed the distance and grabbed the upper arm of Ryūen, who was still holding down Tokitō.
"Tokitō-senpai is a member of my group. If he gets injured here, it could affect tomorrow. No matter how much it's a class issue, I can't overlook it."
Without needing an explanation, Utomiya intervened to mediate the situation, sensing trouble from the tense atmosphere.
"I don't care. Don't join in the barking at this shitty exchange meeting."
"...The problem is the guy who's using his position to threaten at this shitty exchange meeting..."
Far from backing down, Utomiya increased his anger and spoke out against Ryūen.
"What? Then why don't you try stopping me?"
"Are you okay with that? You'll be embarrassed in front of your friends as a senpai."
Having given up on using polite language, Utomiya quickly prepared for a fight.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't start with Ryūen on your own!"
Hōsen, who didn't like it, yelled loudly throughout the corridor.
"Shut up, Hōsen. I don't need you, don't cause unnecessary trouble."
"Huh? What's with you? Do you know who you're talking to?"
"Even if I talk to a big gorilla, words won't get through."
It seemed that Utomiya had come to support Tokitō, but he treated Hōsen the same way as Ryūen.
"Fine, then. I'll start with you before >>>Albert-senpai<<<."
"How many times do I have to tell you? I'll take you on anytime."
Seeing the first years start to quarrel, Ryūen couldn't help but burst out laughing at the unfamiliar sight.
"Hehehe. It's getting quite noisy, this school. I thought it was full of boring, serious people when I entered, but now there are quite a few hot-blooded ones showing their faces. I'm more than welcome."
With the addition of Hōsen and Utomiya, Ryūen released his hold on Tokitō.
He took his gaze off Tokitō, who was sitting down and coughing roughly.

"I'll take your revenge right here, Hōsen. I'll take on your first year all at once while I'm at it."
Ryūen, who no longer cared about Tokitō in this situation, said.
"Sounds good. The camp is getting fun. First, you disappear!"
Hōsen's powerful fist was caught by his own hand, and Albert's lips were tightly closed.
"Oh, you can endure it! That's how it should be!"
The situation was beginning to look like it wouldn't settle down unless it turned violent, but Hōsen's loud voice quickly defused the situation.
"What's going on? What are you guys doing?"
Several boys and girls, led by the third graders, began to appear in the experiential classroom area after hearing the commotion.
"Tsk. It was getting interesting."
"Damn it."
Hōsen, who didn't even think that he was the one who raised his voice, clicked his tongue just like Ryūen.
"It's not a fight, is it?"
"No, it's not. We were just having a light conversation."
Utomiya immediately went in front of the third graders and covered up with that statement.
Seeing that the situation was bad, Ryūen and Hōsen, while glaring at each other, naturally turned their backs and kept their distance.
"Let's go, Albert, and you too, Ishizaki. I'll teach you a lot later."
"Y-yes! Thank you!!"
The three of them ignored the two first-year students and Tokitō who were glaring at them, and left the scene.
As he was leaving, Albert looked at Hōsen's large back and muttered.
"His fighting ability may be equal to or greater than Ayanokoji. He's a tremendous freshman."
The weight of the punch he received was as intense as Ayanokōji's, as the numbness in his hand told him.
It was a statement with the implication that it was good not to have to fight.
However, Ryūen couldn't help but laugh at Albert's remark.
"Don't make me laugh. If it's just simple power, he might be able to compete with him, but if you compare their strength, there's no comparison. The source of Ayanokōji's strength is not so simple."
After spreading his fist and looking at his palm, Albert recalled the incident on the rooftop and agreed.
It was because his heart remembered that he was an opponent who transcended the dimension of weight and lightness.
"But Tokitō, he seemed to be quite into Sakayanagi... Don't we need to do something? Like Hashimoto might betray..."
Ishizaki's anxiety was already anticipated in Ryūen's mind without him having to put it into words.
"Tokitō is not that stupid. We should leave it at that, we've already nailed him enough."
"...Yes. If Ryūen-san says so."
"We'll focus on Class A. The most troublesome one right now is Kitō, not Sakayanagi. He could go berserk at any moment."
"It feels like a conflict."
"Conflict, huh. Indeed, anything could happen from here on out."
The end-of-year exams that will start soon.
Ryūen, who understood that turmoil would occur, began to prepare for what was to come.
3
At this time, I had no way of knowing that there was a dispute going on between Ryūen, Tokitō, and Hōsen. After the bath, I was sitting on the sofa in the lobby, leisurely looking at the ceiling.
It was right next to the seat where Sakayanagi was sitting this morning.
The reconnaissance requested by Hashimoto. I had made contact this morning and was personally satisfied with the results, but I hadn't reported anything, so I was expected to produce results. Even though I didn't feel like it, I thought I should at least do something that looked like it, so I was here.
"Ah~! Ayanokōji-kun, hey, can you listen to my story~!?"
Satō, who seemed to be about to return to her shared room, changed her course when she saw me and approached with a frustrated look.
"What happened?"
"It's the exchange meeting, the exchange meeting. I was seriously aiming for the top, so..."
She didn't try to hide her disappointment, and her shoulders slumped dramatically.
"I wanted to buy something, and I tried my best in my own way. Ugh."
Satō's group had finished 12 matches in two days with seven wins and five losses.
They were doing well enough, but they were in a tough spot for a third-place finish.
"If you keep up the good work, there's a pretty good chance you'll finish in the top 10, isn't there?"

I could get 5000 points just by keeping that place. Not a bad amount.
"Yeah, that's definitely the goal. But what worries me is that the group's motivation has dropped quite a bit because of today's results..."
If they were aiming for a high ranking, it was natural to feel down.
The difference between the top and bottom was extreme in this exchange meeting.
The losing groups had 12 losses in 12 games, or 11 losses, and they just couldn't win.
As a result, the wins were concentrated in groups like the Nagumo group, which were taking it seriously.
The difference between the third-place group and Satō's group was three wins, which was quite significant.
"The last game of today, I regret it..."
"Who was the last group?"
I asked because I didn't know which group Satō's group was fighting against.
Satō showed a slightly regretful face, but told me.
"---It was Minamikawa senpai's group."
It was class 3-C. I remember Onodera was in Minamikawa's group.
It was a well-known fact that Satō and Onodera, who had originally been at odds, were not on good terms, but if they felt they had misspoken, it seemed reasonable to assume that was the cause.
Both Satō and Onodera were normal female students as far as I could tell.
From an outsider's perspective, it wouldn't be strange for them to get along, but that's not how human relationships work.
Is she still not fond of Onodera? It would be easy to ask, but it's not something I should ask.
"You have no choice but to carry that regret into tomorrow. There's still a chance depending on how hard Satō tries."
"...Yeah."
After changing the topic and talking for a while, Satō was called by her group and left.
After that, without gaining anything significant, I returned to my shared room.
"There's no one here."
The room was empty except for a slightly disheveled futon.
When I opened my cell phone, I found a message from Hashimoto that had arrived about 10 minutes ago.
'I'm going to the girls' room, so let's meet up there.'
He was quite carefree for someone I had asked to scout.
Well, going to the opposite sex's room to play might be one of the staples of a training camp.
After restoring the trampled futon, I decided to head to the girls' room.
About five minutes after noticing Hashimoto's message, I visited the girls' shared room.
The same building, the same layout, the same furniture, and decorations.
It's a matter of course, but there's no difference from the shared room the boys are using.
The only difference is the presence of the opposite sex.
Why does it look so different, even though it's neither more nor less than that?
Whether you perceive this as a good space or a bad space is up to each individual.
From the first-year students to Kiryūin in the third year, all the girls were present.
All the first-year boys looked tense but somewhat happy.
Yamamura looked a bit down, his expression darker than usual. He didn't have a turn in this exchange meeting, and I knew the least about how he was spending his time in the group.
"Hey, you came."
"You called me."
The boys seemed to be having more fun than I thought.
But the girls' tension was lower than I thought. In other words, they didn't seem to be having fun.
Two pieces of data come into my brain in an instant.
Hashimoto probably brought the boys to the girls' room to play, somewhat forcibly.
"We're a bit stuck. Do you have anything to liven things up? The room's atmosphere is a bit heavy, isn't it? How about a one-liner to dispel that?"
"I don't have such a gag, but how about this as a small trick?"
I took out a case that I had stuffed in my jersey pocket and showed it to him.
"Oh, that's nice. You're quite thoughtful."
Since the game list for experiential learning also includes cards, there are plenty of them prepared and they can be obtained immediately.

Hashimoto seemed to welcome this, reaching out his hand and asking to borrow it.
When he received it, he opened the case and took out a deck of cards.
"Playing cards is the most classic of classics, isn't it, Ayanokōji?"
Kiryūin, who had been sitting and looking at his phone, called out to me without getting up.
"I was once told by a blonde senpai that playing cards is a staple of training camps."
"Huh? Could it be Nagumo?"
He sat up, leaning back in his chair, and asked with interest.
When I nodded to confirm that he was correct, Kiryūin laughed a little, as if he found the fact amusing.
"That man also does such cliché things."
"Besides, today was the first time a group lost in a card game, so it's also a reflection."
"Playing cards, huh?"
Morishita, who had been looking out the window near Kiryūin, muttered as if he had noticed something.
Then, while sitting properly, he kicked the tatami mat with both hands and came closer.
"Let's do that. That. The game where the person who has the Joker at the end loses."
"You seem very excited... Do you like playing cards?"
"I can't say whether I like it or not. I've never done it before."
"You've never done it? There's really someone like a fossil who exists?"
Hashimoto was surprised, his eyes wide.
"There were no people worth playing cards with me."
Does that mean he didn't have any friends with whom he could have such a relationship until now?
"Wait a minute. That's strange. Didn't you give yourself a 5 for being good at cards?"
Indeed, Morishita had given himself the highest rating of 5 for playing cards.
"I thought I would be strong even if I was inexperienced, given my talent. After all, it was not a confirmation of whether I was good at it or not, but a five-step evaluation of whether I had confidence, right? So, it's 5."
He answered confidently, puffing out his chest. He certainly seemed full of confidence.
"But you didn't seem to be called for today's game."
Only Kiryūin, the leader, knows the answer to why he wasn't chosen.
"That's right. Why didn't you choose me?"
"Isn't it suspicious to say you're confident in playing cards? That's why I left you out."
It seems he made that judgment from the answered list. His impression was correct.
"Well, never mind that. Let's play cards anyway. Please distribute them quickly, Ayanokōji Kiyotaka."
I got the message that he really wanted to do it, so I didn't feel bad about it as the one who brought it. But not everyone can do it at once, so what to do?
"How about this? One game with four people. A tournament for boys only and a tournament for girls only. Then a mixed tournament."
Hashimoto, noticing my indecision, suggested a seating arrangement.
"That's not a bad idea. Let's go with that."
Morishita was already eager, showing no signs of refusal. I thought the quiet Tsubaki might not want to play, but it seemed that the other first-year students, including Tsubaki, were surprisingly enthusiastic.
"How about you come over here, Yamamura?"
I called out to Yamamura, who was sitting alone far away, but he shook his head from side to side.
"Um... I'll... watch."
"Are you sure?"
Yamamura, who seemed to have no intention of participating, nodded slightly in refusal.
"There's no need to include someone who says they don't want to play. Come on, let's get started."
Under the pressure of the energetic Morishita, the girls' card game match began immediately.
"This mixer is a good mixer."
"That's a cheap evaluation. Are you satisfied just because you can play cards?"
Hashimoto, sitting cross-legged, muttered, resting his elbow on his knee.
"I'm satisfied, but please don't look at my cards from behind."
"I won't tell you what's in my hand."
"I don't know when Hashimoto Masayoshi will betray us."

While saying that, he hid his hand with his body.
Hashimoto had a bitter smile on his face, but he was actually the traitor...
"But I can see it now"
Morishita was having his first experience, but he was not just enjoying it, he was also doing his own analysis.
"There are several strategies in this game"
Saying that, Morishita held only one card in his hand so that it stood out conspicuously.
"Please go ahead, Shiina Hiyori. Don't hesitate to draw any card you like"
"Something... I'm a little curious about this one card"
"Isn't that so? This is the advanced strategy I came up with"
By the way, Hashimoto couldn't see it anymore, but now from where I was sitting, I could clearly see Morishita's hand.
Apparently, the isolated card seemed to be a joker.
Because it was suspicious, there should be no joker there. That seemed to be the aim.
From a strategic point of view, it might not be a bad move.
Although it couldn't be proven that the probability itself was increasing, there seemed to be enough power to make her want to draw that one card, to make her want to try it.
"What should I do..."
Hiyori, who was suspicious, tried to escape to the four cards in her right hand, but her fingertips stopped.
She seemed to be bothered by the one card in her left hand.
"Please choose as you like"
Morishita's lack of emotional ups and downs, combined with his personality, made for a perfect distraction.
After a long thought, Hiyori was >>>mesmerized<<< and ended up drawing the one card in her left hand.
She pulled it towards her, turned it over, and was disappointed to find out that the card she had picked was a joker.
Everyone must have realized who had the joker from her obvious reaction.
"You still have a lot to learn if you show it on your face"
After that, the game continued in silence for a few rounds.
The first to go out was the first-year student Eikura, followed by Hatsukawa.
Morishita, who had successfully passed the joker at an early stage, ended up losing to the two first-year students in the subsequent card matching, and it came down to the final showdown with Hiyori.
And then it transitioned to a state where Hiyori held the remaining two cards and Morishita held the last one.
"Please go ahead, Morishita-san"
She smoothly held out two cards in the same way.
Morishita, who stared at them, picked up the card on the right from our point of view with his fingertips.
But he didn't immediately pull it, he spoke up.
"Is this it?"
"...What is it?"
"I thought it might not be the joker"
"I can't answer that"
"I think it's the joker"
"I see... then you might want to avoid it. Do you want me to switch?"
"Is that okay? You'll lose, you know?"
"But I don't actually know which one is the joker"
"You're naive, Shiina Hiyori. The mystery is all solved"
Morishita let go of the card he was holding, grabbed the one on the left, and pulled it out with force.
The card Morishita showed us was---a five of hearts.
"I win"
"I lost"
Hiyori seemed to be enjoying even her loss, though she looked disappointed.
On the other hand, Morishita seemed to be driven by a desire to win at all costs.
After that, they played a game with only boys, and then moved on to a mixed game of boys and girls.
"Let's move on to the next game, the next game"

Morishita still wanted to play, but I voiced a concern that had been on my mind for a while.
"Isn't it about time Yamamura joined in?"
"...No, I'm...fine..."
She had been watching us the whole time, but her gaze didn't seem to be on the game.
She looked distracted and not at all energetic.
I had hoped that playing cards would cheer her up, but maybe that was too much to ask.
"Yamamura-san. Won't you join us? It's fun."
At that moment, Hiyori approached and invited her.
"But..."
"Come on, please join us."
Unable to refuse Hiyori's gentle demeanor, Yamamura reluctantly joined in. But as soon as the game started, unexpected troubles occurred.
"Um, it's my turn..."
"Oops, sorry Yamashitasenpai. Please, go ahead and draw."
Yamamura, who was about to be skipped by the student next to her, hastily offered her card.
Her name was mistaken, but she didn't even bother to correct it.
Even though we were all sitting in a circle, the student drawing from Yamamura's hand skipped her.
Maybe she had been avoiding the card game because she feared this would happen.
A single mistake could be overlooked, but when it happened repeatedly, it was noticeable even to me, watching from the sidelines.
Was Yamamura's presence really that faint?
I had known about her tailing skills for a while, but it was usually impossible to overlook her when watching with the naked eye.
However, it was unclear whether this was because I was consciously recognizing Yamamura, or because others were not paying attention to her.
I decided to ask someone the next time I had the chance.
4
On the way back from the girls' room.
When I checked my phone, I realized it was almost lights-out time, and it was quite late.
"Man, that was fun! But why do girls' rooms smell so good?"
"Right, right... And wasn't Tsubaki-san cute?"
"Really? Are you a Tsubaki fan?"
The first-year students couldn't hide (or didn't want to hide) their excitement about their first visit to a girls' room.
"It looks like they had fun."
Seeing the excited kōhai, Hashimoto seemed satisfied that it was worth bringing them along.
But the next moment, the smile disappeared from Hashimoto's face, replaced by a stern expression.
"Sorry, but could you guys go back first? Ayanokōji, could you stay with me a little longer?"
When he told everyone but me, they all obediently agreed and went back to their shared room.
"What's wrong?"
"You'll just go to sleep when you get back to your room, right? I haven't heard anything about Sakayanagi."
"If you were expecting to learn something, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there's nothing."
"But you did meet Sakayanagi today, didn't you?"
Indeed, I had encountered Sakayanagi this morning.
Whether he had obtained information from somewhere or was simply trying to fish for it with a lie, I didn't need to probe.
Either way, my answer was already decided.
"I did put some pressure on her, but she's Sakayanagi. Honestly, I couldn't get much out of her. You know she's a tough opponent, right?"
Regardless of what I said, Hashimoto would likely be suspicious, so I continued speaking calmly.
"Besides, I didn't have time to have a leisurely conversation."
To avoid deep questioning, I included an excuse-like implication in my words.
"...Well, it's fine. Either way, the outcome won't change in the future."
That outcome, needless to say, was something Hashimoto would voice, not me.

"Sakayanagi and Ryūen dropped out of the championship race on the second day. It ended uneventfully and without much fanfare."
 Sakayanagi's group had 5 wins and 7 losses in 12 matches. Ryūen's group had 3 wins and 9 losses in 12 matches.
 Unless there's a major upset in tomorrow's 7 matches, their chances of ranking high are hopeless.
"Well, I guess they gave up on the exchange meeting. Those two didn't show up at any of the experiential learning sessions. They probably didn't intend to receive any rewards from the start, right?"
"That seems to be the case. But you don't look too happy about it."
"Well, of course, it's unsettling. It's weird that those two dropped out so >>>unimpressively<<<."
 Hashimoto is naturally suspicious.
 Both groups disappeared from the top ranks without ever making a comeback.
 I can understand why Hashimoto would be cautious just looking at the results.
 But that's probably an unnecessary worry.
 Ryūen values private points, but the private points available at this camp are very special as announced beforehand, and are limited to shopping.
 Of course, it's good to have them, but it's not unreasonable for Ryūen not to prioritize them.
 Rather, being able to move freely for three days might be more advantageous from an information standpoint.
 It would be better to keep an eye on Sakayanagi's situation for now.
 On the other hand, Sakayanagi, who lost in the special test of survival and dropout, should use this exchange meeting to cool down for the future.
 Spending a leisurely time in nature and healing wounds is one of the best actions.
 That's why Hashimoto should be prepared, but he's not.
 He's trying to keep calm, but he can't hide his impatience.
"I thought Sakayanagi, being smart, would have me investigated every now and then..."
 Even in the relaxed exchange meeting, she might be aiming for expulsion. Hashimoto should have that level of crisis awareness.
"It's not like Toyohashi and the other first-years have already been won over by Sakayanagi, right?"
 He didn't confirm it in words every time, but the first thing Hashimoto did was to get along with the kōhai, presumably to prevent that from happening.
"Could it be that Sakayanagi had set up a spy even before we formed the group?"
"Don't you know better about the relationship with the first-years, Hashimoto?"
 Long before the exchange meeting, right after the kōhai joined Manabu-shi, the fact that they were working as Sakayanagi's legs hasn't changed.
"Yeah... probably... not. Basically, Sakayanagi didn't move for direct negotiations, and I was basically the one who interacted with the promising first-years. But indirectly---"
 He was desperately trying to smile, but he was cornering himself.
"It's not easy to expel someone in a special test other than the special test."
 I tried to calm him down a bit, but while my words reached him, he couldn't fully digest them.
"I know. I know, but... it's Sakayanagi. I can't deny the possibility that she might do something I can't imagine."
 After saying that, he stopped, perhaps realizing that he was stuck in a quagmire.
"Let's stop. I should forget about Sakayanagi for now."
"That's better."
 Hashimoto took a deep breath, filling his cheeks with air, and exhaled strongly to regulate his breathing.
"Alright, I'll stop by the lobby toilet before I go back. You can go back and sleep first."
"It's almost lights out, don't be too late."
"Yeah."
 Whether he found the shared toilet uncomfortable or had another purpose.
 Hashimoto went into the lobby toilet, which was now devoid of people.
〇Quiet Conclusion
 Today is the third day of living with other grades.
 By tomorrow afternoon, we'll probably be on the bus back to school.
 The exchange meeting is nearing its end, and a battle with the Nagumo group is looming, but Horikita and Ibuki were still showing up early in the morning.
"You, do the match with us blindfolded today."
"You're demanding right off the bat. And it's an unreasonable request."
"I have to kick you at least once, or I'll be frustrated."
 That unreasonable proposal was obviously unacceptable. If the opponent was inexperienced in martial arts, it would be a different story, but against Horikita and Ibuki, even I would struggle if I were blindfolded.
 Especially since I'm focusing on defense, it would just be taking on unnecessary risk.

"Refusing because it won't lead to special training"
"Well said, Horikita"
"Let's do it after the special training if you insist"
"That's not it, Horikita"
I corrected Horikita in less than a second.
"I can understand your frustration, Ayanokōji-kun. But first, we should prioritize defeating Amasawa-san. Right?"
"...Well, yeah"
Even though I was helping quite devotedly, it was quite a thing to say.
Anyway, it seemed that the determination was enough to succeed in the revenge against Amasawa.
"Then let's start right away---"
Just as I was about to speak, Ibuki stopped me.
"Toilet"
"Haven't you finished yet?"
"I thought I was fine. But when it gets cold, I have to go a little, so wait for me"
"Really..."
Although Horikita was exasperated, it was cruel to tell her to hold it in.
If by any chance, she moved around actively and the plug loosened, it would be a big problem.
While seeing off Ibuki who went back to the toilet, Horikita started talking.
"There's something I realized today"
"What did you realize?"
"The reason you made the revenge against Amasawa-san on the morning of the fourth day a condition. The reason to increase the number of special training sessions is plausible, but if you wanted to make time, you could have done it not only in the early morning but also secretly. The main reason you chose the last day was to manage the risk of injury, wasn't it? If you get injured in a selfish fight before the exchange meeting is settled, it would be unacceptable to those who are seriously doing it"
Horikita's group is a candidate for first place, unlike Ibuki's group, which lost the chance to win in the second day. It seems she was able to notice that perspective as someone who stands on top.
"With your skills, you can handle it without injuring me, right?"
"What if I get injured?"
"...Is there a possibility?"
"No, there isn't"
As soon as I replied, she showed a slightly irritated face.
"If a normal person said that, they would definitely get a frown, so be careful. Maybe I should have you play blindfolded later?"
"Please don't. I thought I didn't need to hold back against Horikita. I wouldn't say such a thing to anyone else"
"Is that something I should be happy about...?"
"You should be, it's special treatment"
"That's not a happy kind of special treatment"
Recently, I've been having more and more casual conversations with Horikita.
In the world, including the past and the future, there must be others who have similar exchanges, getting angry and laughing together.
"It's completely unrelated, but who comes to mind when you think of a student with a thin presence?"
When I asked that, Horikita thought for a moment and then gave her answer.
"Ayanokōji-kun"
"...Me?"
"At least when you first entered Manabu-shi, you were one of the less noticeable ones in the class"
"I see, indeed"
Among the 40 students at the time of admission, I would have been overwhelmingly faster if counted from the bottom.
"Recently, you've been gaining more presence, so it doesn't apply now"
Indeed, compared to the beginning, I think I've changed a lot.
The surrounding environment has changed more than anything else.
"I wonder where the thickness and thinness of the shadow is decided"
"Hmm, I see. If you want to disappear or don't want to stand out, I think your shadow naturally becomes thinner. You probably don't speak much either"
All of these fit Yamamura.
Each one may not be a big deal, but when combined, they may have a big impact.

"Is something wrong?"
"No, I was just wondering about something."
"Really? Oh right, about the matter you asked me to look into---"
When Horikita brought up the topic of special training, it was something I had asked her to do.
The results were now being reported by Horikita.
"...That's about all I noticed... Will it be of any use?"
"Yes, it will be very useful. Thanks for looking into it. You can consider the request fulfilled."
Horikita, who had faithfully complied, seemed to not understand the meaning from start to finish, but she didn't try to inquire deeply about the reason.
"But Ibuki is really late."
"Indeed. I wonder what she's doing."
If she had just gone to the bathroom in the lobby and returned, it wouldn't have taken this long.
"Did she go back to her room and fall asleep?"
"I'd like to think not... but with Ibuki-san, you never know."
"What about her phone?"
"She said it would be a nuisance and left it in her room."
"I see. I hate to say this to you, Horikita, but if Ibuki doesn't come back, we'll have to cancel today."
"It can't be helped. The condition was that Ibuki-san would fight with us."
The special training from yesterday was just a drop in the bucket, but there was nothing we could do.
It might be best to propose a postponement, hoping that there will be another opportunity to go out together in a place with lax supervision like a training camp or a deserted island.
As Horikita and I were looking in the direction of the building, waiting for Ibuki to appear.
"There's an opening!!"
With that voice from behind, a presence rapidly approached. When we moved away from the spot, Ibuki's foot was extended where we had been standing just a moment ago.
She was clearly intending to kick us by surprise.
"Damn! I missed! I even took the long way back!"
"It's fine to be frustrated, but don't announce your attack. You're doing the same thing as Ishizaki."
"Ugh...!? I don't want to hear that...! But I just instinctively shouted!"
An instinctive shout is not excusable.
It's only a disadvantage against an opponent with low odds of winning, unless you know you can definitely take them down.
"Ishizaki-kun? Have you had a dispute with Ishizaki-kun too?"
"I just witnessed such a scene. I'm not involved."
I thought I could deceive her by saying something appropriate, but it seemed to be a rash judgment.
"You had a dispute with Ryūen-kun on the rooftop, didn't you? That time, right?"
I looked at Ibuki. Her frustrated expression had changed to a malicious grin.
"Hmph, I don't remember being told to keep my mouth shut by you. Even if I was, it's my freedom to talk."
"I don't mind, but it makes a lot of sense."
The part where she asked me for instructions for revenge on Amasawa seems to have been influenced by that.
"I pretended not to know in front of others, but it might have been a good opportunity. Do you admit that you had a big fight with Ryūen-kun and his group?"
"I can't deny it in this situation."
"I see. But for me, it finally makes sense. I didn't doubt Ibuki-san's story, but it wouldn't be strange if there were exaggerations or mistakes mixed in."
Huh? She tilted her head and kicked up the dirt towards Horikita's knees.
"Don't act like a child."
While scolding her like a teacher, Horikita continued as if she had been waiting for this opportunity.
"Do you have anything else you're keeping from me? Like other people you've had disputes with?"
"None."
"Really? ...I still have a few things I'm suspicious about. Like the Yagami-kun incident."
"Yagami? Why is Yagami coming up now? I don't use violence against my juniors. I'd like to exclude the Hōsen incident though."
"Who's Yagami? Was there such a person?"
"...Fine. We don't have much time, so can we start the special training?"

Unable to explain everything to Ibuki, Horikita cut off the conversation. She began to distance herself from me. 
"Basically, the rules are the same as yesterday. The important thing is to understand how the two of you will move, not my movements." 
If they had faced each other many times in the past, they would have inevitably ingrained each other's patterns in their minds. 
The teamwork that was honed here would undoubtedly be higher than in the previous Amasawa battle. 
1
After finishing their morning training, the two were out of breath for a while, but they couldn't sit here forever. 
"It's getting brighter. Should we go back soon?" 
"You say that so casually. How can your body not be tired after all that movement?" 
"Are you a cyborg or something?" 
"I'm tired too. I just don't show it on my face." 
"You say that, but you're not even breathing hard. It's not convincing at all." 
Despite her complaints, Horikita stood up, brushing off the sand. 
"We do need to go back soon." 
Seeing this, Ibuki also stood up immediately, even jumping high once. 
She seemed to be competing, but her efforts were not reciprocated. 
"By the way, Ibuki-san, what are you planning to do today?" 
"What do you mean?" 
"The exchange meeting game. Is your group planning to fight to the end?" 
Ibuki's group was already at a hopeless 2 wins and 10 losses. 
"Oh, that? I don't know. I haven't participated once." 
"Then your stamp card must be blank." 
Ibuki snorted and crossed her arms. She probably wanted the reward, but she seemed likely to choose to skip the troublesome work for a mere 1000 points. 
"I'm free, so I might as well go with Horikita." 
"...Why would you do that?" 
"I might get to see you lose at the exchange meeting or something." 
Ibuki's motivation was clear, or rather, she never wavered. 
Just like Kushida, did she really want to see Horikita lose that much? 
"Eh? Are you really going to stick around?" 
"Of course." 
"Even if you're sure to lose, will you obey if the third-years tell you to participate?" 
"I won't obey. I'll just have someone else do it." 
I wouldn't be surprised if Ibuki pushed that role onto a first-year. 
Each group had its own circumstances, and neither Horikita nor Ibuki had the right to deny the other's thoughts. 
"Whatever... do as you like, but why not go with Ayanokōji-kun? You might get to see him lose too." 
"Didn't he lose twice yesterday?" 
My information was undoubtedly shared within the Nagumo group. 
"Speaking of which, Nagumosenpai was really happy. He said it was a disappointing end to an unbeaten streak, losing at cards, of all things. Did you lose another game after that?" 
She didn't seem to know much. Perhaps Nagumo didn't share my individual results with the entire group, but only with a select few students? 
"I was completely beaten by Inogashira in Patchwork." 
"It's a reversal phenomenon that would never happen normally. I wanted to see you lose, no matter what the game was." 
"So you're no different from Ibuki." 
At that retort, she seemed a little disgruntled, but eventually laughed and nodded. 
In other words, she couldn't help but want to see someone she disliked lose. 
"He doesn't seem to mind losing, does he? He might even lose on purpose." 
"I don't know about on purpose, but he does seem to regret it. At least, judging by his current state, the two losses were serious. Right? Red panda-kun?" 
"Are you still going with that joke..." 
I wish she wouldn't arbitrarily nickname me Red Panda.

"Well, I guess I'll go with Horikita. I'd like to keep an eye on Amasawa too."
"I see, that might not be a bad idea. If she's even slightly aware of you, it might put pressure on her for tomorrow."
Horikita had found merit in Ibuki accompanying her.
"Can you hurry up and get back? It's getting cold."
Naturally, the body that had warmed up from exercise would cool down if it remained still for too long.
"Just don't get in the way."
"I can't promise that."
She couldn't help but sense Ibuki's scheme to interfere if she could.
2
In about 15 minutes, the opponents for the first exchange meeting of the third day would be announced.
The game was 'shogi'.
The participants were me, Morishita, Hashimoto, Hiyori, and Tsubaki, who were chosen by Kiryūin.
Despite this, the group was about to face this moment short of one member.
"Where the hell did Morishita go? It's his turn next..."
"It seems that his cell phone is not connecting."
Hiyori, holding her cell phone to her ear, informed me that she couldn't reach him.
"When was the last time you saw Morishita?"
"The last time I saw him was at breakfast. You left with Ayanokōji-kun, right?"
Since we finished eating at the same time, I remembered leaving the dining hall at the same time.
It was more than 30 minutes ago, but he said he was going for a walk.
Could he still be on his walk, or could he have gotten lost?
Normally, he wouldn't get lost, but if he had forced himself to go into the mountain path, it would be a different story.
Given Morishita's personality, it wasn't impossible.
"He was saying that he was absolutely confident in shogi..."
"He said he had trained in online matches."
"That's honestly suspicious..."
Kiryūin had hired him based on that statement and confidence.
He must have wanted to redeem his disgrace in archery.
"If Morishita is out, we'll have to find a substitute, but we still have a little time, so I'll go look outside. Hashimoto, can you check inside?"
"Okay. I'll contact you if I find him."
I bravely set out to search and found Morishita, who didn't seem to be lost, in just a few seconds.
Before calling out to him, I sent a message to Hashimoto that I had found Morishita.
Then I approached him and called out.
"It's almost time for the exchange meeting."
Despite my call, Morishita didn't respond.
He was just quietly touching a tree.
He wasn't sleeping standing up, so what was he doing?
"Morishita?"
"Could you please be quiet? I was listening to the voice of the forest."
Morishita murmured quietly.
"...Huh?"
However, I couldn't process his words in my head and inadvertently asked him again.
"The voice of the forest, what is that?"
"Don't you understand? The forest is alive."
"If you touch a >>>large tree<<< like this, close your eyes, and calm your mind and listen, you might understand what I'm saying."
"...I see?"
So far, I haven't been able to understand what Morishita is saying at all.

"You might want to try this once," I suggested.
I stood next to Morishita and pressed my hand against the tree in the same way.
Then I closed my eyes.
All I had to do was calm my mind and listen.
"Do you hear it? The voice of the forest."
"No..."
"Then you might still have some distractions."
Distractions. Unfortunately, I was currently emptying my emotions.
There was no way such a thing could be mixed in...
As I thought, I couldn't hear anything at all. There was no way I could.
"Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth."
But Morishita still insisted.
"Does that make any sense?"
"I don't know? When I had a cold before, I was instructed to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth at the otolaryngologist's office."
"Isn't that how to use a nebulizer..."
In a way, I was forcibly filled with distractions.
Anyway, I couldn't hear the voice of the forest.
"What are you doing?"
When I opened my eyes and looked at Morishita, he was pointing his cell phone camera at me.
"I was recording Ayanokōji Kiyotaka being fooled by my lies in high-definition mode."
"Hey..."
"There's no way you can hear the voice of the forest. You've watched too many dramas and movies."
"You're the one who started it. You seemed to be practicing it."
"Don't be shy. I'll keep it a secret that you were trying to listen to the voice of the forest."
I wish he wouldn't record and leave evidence like that.
"But I didn't know that the suction machine in the hospital is called a nebulizer. I've learned some useless knowledge. Thank you."
The fact that he called it useless knowledge means that he wasn't really grateful.
"Ayanokōji Kiyotaka, you're an interesting person."
I wonder if I'm the only one who thinks Morishita is overwhelmingly more interesting.
"By the way, do you need something from me?"
"I came to look for you because you didn't show up when it was time to gather."
"Now that you mention it, I feel like I might have been at fault."
Accepting his apology-like statement, Morishita moved away from the tree.
He started walking towards the building where Kiryūin was waiting.
"Can I ask you something?"
I only turned my gaze towards Morishita, silently urging him to speak.
"What do you think about Hashimoto Masayoshi?"
"That's a pretty deep question."
"I thought I needed to ask. I've been looking for an opportunity several times, but I couldn't find the right time."
"Did you think I would come looking for you because you were entrusting yourself to the trees?"
"I did think you would come looking for me on your own."
He has a strange personality, but he's a strategist.
"What do you think of him as a fellow A-class student?"
"I thought you'd ask. Of course, I think we should unite as a class and exclude him."
He decisively called Hashimoto a nuisance.
"What if I were on Hashimoto's side? Wouldn't that be a slip of the tongue?"
"I thought if I lied, I would only be lied to in return. So I thought honesty was the best choice here."
He understands the game well.

Just hinting at relief for Hashimoto with a poor facade wouldn't earn any trust if sniffed out.
His judgment was quick and sharp. And he didn't mince his words.
Among the same-age students I had seen, he was quite exceptional in these abilities.
Indeed, you can't understand such a personality unless you meet and talk face-to-face.
"I intend to respond to that honesty, but honestly, I think it's a problem that has nothing to do with me from another class. Whether Sakayanagi tries to exclude Hashimoto in the future, or Hashimoto tries to exclude Sakayanagi, they can do as they please."
"So you're saying you have no intention of siding with Hashimoto Masayoshi?"
"None."
I nodded without hesitation, strongly appealing that this was the truth.
That attitude might be doubted, but in fact, I was speaking the truth, not a lie.
"Of course, as a member of the same group now, I will maintain an appropriate distance and cooperative relationship."
"Is that so? I feel a little relieved."
It might be closer to say anti-Hashimoto than Sakayanagi faction.
"I want to ask for reference, but would it be a problem if I sided with Hashimoto?"
"It would be. I think Sakayanagi Arisu would win nine out of ten times, but if Ayanokōji Kiyotaka were to side with Hashimoto Masayoshi, that might be in jeopardy."
Apparently, Morishita seemed to value my existence more than I had imagined.
"Is it strange? That I highly value Ayanokōji Kiyotaka."
"I didn't feel that way when we first talked."
Of course, I understood that I was being watched, but not to this extent.
"It's often the case that the preconceived notion and the actual content are different in a bad way. So I had lowered the hurdle, but looking at the reactions and gazes around me, it doesn't seem to be the case."
It seemed to be more of a gut feeling than something she had directly seen or heard.
An evaluation based on her high intelligence and senses.
A female version of Kōenji, it would be rude to Morishita to say that, but in terms of type, they might be a little similar. Like subtracting the eccentricity and adding the essence of reason...
No, no matter how I express it, it's not right to compare her to Kōenji.
"Then, is there a possibility that you will side with Sakayanagi Arisu?"
"None. Rather, she's not someone I should interfere with."
Originally, Hashimoto is a much lower opponent for Sakayanagi. It's not a situation where I should lend a hand.
"But..."
"But?"
"I do think that both Hashimoto and Sakayanagi should fight with their full strength. It's best to decide the winner after they both exert all the power they can. That's just my opinion though."
Hashimoto, who is still running alone without the luxury of looking around, and Sakayanagi, who might not be able to exert her full power because of dragging Kamuro around.
If I can eliminate the problems they each have, I would like to eliminate them before the match.
"I understand Ayanokōji Kiyotaka's thoughts well. Thank you."
Perhaps having cleared something in her mind, Morishita slightly smiled and bowed her head.
"I hope this problem will be resolved as soon as possible. If the infighting continues for half a year or a year, it will only be a minus for class A."
"That's true."
If it's that problem, it will end up being Morishita's groundless fear.
The problem between Sakayanagi and Hashimoto is already set to end soon.
Morishita started walking away from under the tree.
"Well, let's get going. Don't play in the forest forever. You're such a child."
"You're the one who was playing..."
I'm just a victim who got dragged into this.
To add, Morishita was as good at shogi as she boasted.
Her skills honed through daily online battles were not for show.
3
At times like this, I wonder if we'll face the Nagumo group in the final 19th match.
That's what you might think, but things don't always go as planned.
In the 17th match, still with two personal losses, we clashed with the still undefeated Nagumo group.
The content was 'archery', the second time after table tennis in the exchange meeting.

This wasn't just a game of luck or craftsmanship, should it be considered a good show? 
Nagumo was present as a leader, but he didn't speak up. 
This time, Nagumo and I had a personal bet, but few knew about it. 
Even the first-year students who had been ordered to scout might not know the details. 
"So, why are you here, Morishita?" 
"Of course, I'm here to do archery. I came to fight." 
He had a disastrous result yesterday, but was he still trying to participate without learning his lesson? 
Looking at Kiryūin, he nodded deeply once. It seemed he had accepted Morishita's participation. 
"That's how it is. You can think of it as being on a big ship, AyanokōjiKiyotaka." 
"Let's hope it's not a sinking ship." 
The instructor started again, talking about safety to students who had never handled archery before, and those who had. He repeatedly explained the importance of learning the correct shooting form. 
Unlike the original rules, the format was to switch after shooting six arrows, not alternately. 
Hashimoto, who had seen the five opponents, approached and whispered in my ear. 
"Katsuragi apparently practiced quite a bit yesterday. And he scored a maximum of 36 points. There's a chance you could lose if you face him." 
I was impressed by his thorough research as I reflected on myself. 
Yesterday, my scores were 2, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9 for a total of 30 points. 
I understood his concern, but to put it bluntly, I probably wouldn't lose to Katsuragi. 
The problem was elsewhere. Soon, the match-ups were announced. 
First up: HorikitaSuzune vs Yanagiasu 
Second up: Hirata Yōsuke vs Hashimoto Masayoshi 
Third up: Amasawa Ichika vs AyanokōjiKiyotaka 
Fourth up: Kanzaki Ryūji vs >>>Shintoku Tarō<<< 
Fifth up: Katsuragi Kōhei vs Morishita Ai 
In the 16 matches so far, I had always fought as the third player. 
Nagumo had brilliantly matched his opponent to this fixed position of ours. 
"Nice to meet you, senpai." 
"Your opponent is a first-year girl. You're lucky." 
Hashimoto, who apparently didn't have information about Amasawa, answered optimistically. 
While everyone watched, the Nagumo group, who were up first, started aiming at the target all at once. 
You could tell by their calm demeanor and relaxed expressions. 
Amasawa had finished practicing archery yesterday and seemed to have solidly gained experience. 
Without hesitation, the smoothly released arrows pierced the yellow 9-point area. 
9 points, 9 points, 10 points, 9 points, 10 points, 10 points. A total of 57 points. 
The accuracy was so high that not only the participating students but also the instructors were surprised. 
"No way..." 
Katsuragi, who came in second, had scored a considerable 37 points, but it was incomparable. 
In order for us to win, we needed to score 10 points with every shot. 
Still shaken, it was time for the Kiryūin group, who were on the defensive, to take their turn. 
In the silent gallery, I was the first to release my first arrow. 
It pierced the yellow 8-point area. 
While the other students were still fumbling with their preparations, I shifted to fire my second arrow and waited for permission. 
This left us with only one point of leeway, but that didn't matter. 
I immediately corrected the trajectory that had been slightly off with the first touch. 
The second arrow pierced the yellow 10-point center. 
If this had been a 70-meter distance, it might have been impossible due to factors like wind, but at 20 meters, there were no drawbacks. 
As the instructor collected the arrows, I shot without a moment's delay. 
I repeated the same motion like a machine. 
The same motion, the same position, I just needed to maximize the repeatability.

Without worrying about how many points the others had, I just kept shooting the remaining four arrows straight into the center.
58 to 57. I drew victory to myself.
I received a strong applause from Amasawa, with whom I had a close match.
"You're amazing, senpai. It's frustrating, but I lost, didn't I?"
"I was saved by various rules. The target was close, but if it had been the regular alternating rule, it wouldn't have been strange for the game to go either way."
Once Amasawa had confirmed 57 points, she couldn't make any other moves.
She just had to leave it to my result.
"I was trying to put pressure on you, but it didn't work, did it?"
I had blocked out all the surrounding noise, so I didn't know.
"You didn't practice archery other than yesterday's game, did you?"
"I watched some instructional videos in the middle of the night."
Not just archery, but everything I experienced at the camp.
"It's amazing that you can produce results like that. Nagumo senpai might get angry."
Even though she lost, Amasawa scored 57 points, so Nagumo probably couldn't blame her.
Ibuki, who had been watching from afar, blatantly looked away in boredom.
Horikita won against Yanagi, Amasawa lost but scored an overwhelming high score, and then I won against Amasawa. It must not have been interesting at all.
"That was close. But it was incredibly stable..."
After watching Amasawa return to report to her group, Hashimoto expressed his admiration.
"But the opponent was strong after all."
The archery match between the Nagumo group and the Kiryūin group ended with a 1-4 loss.
"Indeed. They were worthy opponents, the top contenders. But it was a close game."
Morishita, who had given it his all, showed a satisfied look on his face.
By the way, the only one who scored a total of 6 points and suffered a big loss in this game was Morishita.
〇
After that, the round-robin tournament of all 19 games ended.
The final record of the Kiryūin group was 15 wins and 4 losses in 19 games. My personal record was 17 wins and 2 losses.
The final ranking was 4th, which could be said to be a great success.
And the Nagumo group, which had been touted as the top contender from the beginning, came in first with 18 wins and 1 loss.
This one loss was due to a card game chosen in the final match, where they had avoided the element of luck until the end, and they were defeated by a group that had only won three times so far, which was a fitting end to the game.
In the cleared rest area.
Now, only Nagumo and I were in this space.
"Allowing up to two losses was the cause of Nagumo senpai's defeat, wasn't it?"
"Indeed, I'd like to say so, but since you were the only one who participated in more than 12 games and had less than two losses, it would be absurd to complain about that."
Nagumo, who can get detailed information from the leaders of each group at any time, seems to know the individual results of all the games. He is very observant, contrary to his appearance.
"It was impressive how you cleanly hit the best player, Amasawa."
"Don't flatter me. You were doing it on purpose at third place, weren't you? It was obvious that you were setting it up so that I could be somewhat satisfied when I faced you."
"I wish you would sincerely accept the intentions of a kōhai who is trying to praise you, senpai."
"Then do it better. It sounds like you're just provoking me."
I see... Maybe I should have used a more natural and skillful way of speaking.
"I managed to win against Amasawa in the individual match, but from the perspective of the group match, we were completely defeated. Everyone in our group was giving it their all, but it was clear that everyone was playing the game at a high level."
Thoroughly, the experience gained by the group members over the three days directly led to the victory.
"When I decide to go for the win, I go for it without mercy. It's only natural. Well, we both got played by the cards, didn't we?"
"Indeed."
The game that was realized by showing up at an unnecessary exchange meeting and even using the method of paying out of his own pocket. Regardless of winning or losing, I can't imagine that it was satisfying for Nagumo.
"What do you think would have happened if you and I had been competing on group performance from the beginning?"
"Knowing the conclusion, I don't think I could have won even if I had been in charge."
I honestly admit defeat.
"Really? I thought you could have maneuvered behind the scenes and proceeded more solidly and securely."

But, the man in front of me didn't believe in my defeatist statement more than I did.
"You've won 15 times without doing anything, so you're doing great, but wasn't there a way to go for others? Or couldn't you get serious if I was your opponent?"
"That's irrelevant. Even if I tried to pick up a win by buying a losing game, if Nagumo-senpai got serious, he would buy it back, or he would have tried to seal it in advance. He has control over all the seniors, so he should be good at that kind of thing."
If I tried to influence things, Nagumo would naturally sense it and try to influence things as well.
It was a part where I couldn't win even if I stood on my head in a battle of financial power.
"Even if the three acquisitions had gone well, we would have been stuck in the 17th game of archery anyway."
"It doesn't sound like you're serious about that either."
"Well---if I was told to win at all costs, I might have manipulated Horikita and Yōsuke to miss the target so that I could win."
They were serious students, but depending on the reason, they might be on my side.
Even if Nagumo had made a contract to ensure that he would do his best, he couldn't corner him if he was betrayed at that point because there was no guarantee that he would always hit the target.
"I guess so."
"But if Nagumo-senpai could foresee that, he would have changed the members."
It was only natural that he would select students who were not affected by my negotiations.
"So what do you do on top of that---no, this is just unnecessary talk that doesn't mean anything anymore."
Feeling empty, Nagumo closed the conversation himself.
Looking at reality, this was just a social gathering.
It was nothing more than experiential learning that didn't require the tension recognized by the school.
It was not something to invest a lot of money in, or to carry out a campaign of influence.
This reading was just a fantasy, something that never came to fruition.
"I enjoyed the experiential learning seriously. If a fair fight couldn't be realized, I thought it would be polite to show the truth as it is."
Nagumo had always wanted to know my strength.
So, in any form, he must have been able to feel the raw part of me that was not tainted by my clumsy operations. Because students from the Nagumo group, such as Takahashi, were attached to all the games.
He must have filmed and checked the situation.
"That's right. Especially the archery was impressive. I could tell that your hands are unnecessarily dexterous."
"I don't know if Nagumo-senpai was satisfied with this approach."
"Satisfied? There's no way I could be."
Nagumo tilted his head in disbelief and laughed.
"But you've become quite talkative, and your mouth has become sharp."
"I was blessed with a good senpai and was allowed to study."
Nagumo took out his cell phone and flicked the screen with his fingertips.
"I have no intention of belittling your victory. I've transferred the money. Check it."
"I trust you on that. But is it okay? It's a source of funds for the senior relief."
"How long do you think I've been reigning at the top of A? I have several million yen just in my personal money. What's the problem with paying from a part of that?"
As he put away his cell phone, Nagumo looked outside once.
"Do you remember what I told you when I came here? About going to college."
"Of course."
"I was quite serious about inviting you. We can't have flashy battles like in ANHS at university, but on the other hand, we can do more things side by side. Right?"
"Maybe."
"If you want, come to the same university. I'll make your boring personality a little better."
"I'll keep that in mind."
Saying that, Nagumo gently patted my right shoulder as he passed by.
"See you."
"Can I ask you to pass on a message to Nagumo-senpai, who is graduating?"
"Huh? A message? To Horikita-senpai?"
"That wouldn't be bad, but no."
I left a message for a certain person to Nagumo, who had stopped.
Having heard it, Nagumo, who still didn't fully believe it, listened to the end without making fun of it.
"That's a strange message."

"I hope you can convey that. After that, the decision is up to the other party."
"I certainly heard it, but is this your farewell gift to me? If I kept quiet, I wouldn't know what the outcome would have been. There are people who wouldn't be happy about me graduating from Class A as it is."
"At least I think senpai has left enough achievements and qualifications to graduate from Class A."
That was the reason I entrusted Nagumo with the message.
"I'll start the second round at Horikitasenpai's place a step ahead."
Feel free to join if you feel like it.
That was the last word with a message from such a senpai.
〇Quiet night
It was past 11 p.m., past the lights-out time.
In the shared room, it seemed that everyone was still awake, spending time talking in a low voice or looking at their mobile phones. At the beginning of the camp, the unfamiliar members made the atmosphere uncomfortable, but now I didn't care where that atmosphere had gone.
While occasionally participating in conversations with Hashimoto, Oda, and kōhai, and nodding along, my mobile phone vibrated once as I was watching a patchwork video.
'Are you still awake?'
Such a message from Hiyori was displayed at the top of the screen.
'I'm awake. All the boys are still awake, so don't worry.'
I told her so to make it easier for her to send messages in succession.
'Thank you. Actually, I just noticed that Yamamura-san is missing.'
Yamamura is missing? It's basically forbidden to leave the room after lights-out.
'You mean outside the room? What about his mobile phone?'
'It seems to be left in the room. I was wondering whether to go and look for him now... I was wondering if I could borrow your strength, Ayanokōji-kun.'
Probably, Hiyori is not good at this kind of action, to say the least. Especially if she can't act without a trace, the punchline is that she will be found by the patrolling teacher right away.
It can be said that it was the right decision to ask for help here.
The camp is almost over, but it seems better not to leave Yamamura alone.
He had a particularly gloomy expression during yesterday's card game.
There is something that comes to mind as the reason. I should go and look for him right away.
'I understand. I'll go and check on him, so Hiyori, please wait in the room. When Yamamura comes back to the room, we need a way to confirm that.'
When I told her that it would be more useful for her to stay in the room without going out, a reply came back with a cute animal stamp saying 'Thank you'.
"I'm going out for a bit."
"Eh? Hey, it's past lights-out, you know? If they find you, they'll get mad."
"I'm looking for something. I'll try to come back without being found as much as possible. If something happens, please get scolded with me."
When I answered that way, Hashimoto and the others didn't try to stop me strongly, but rather seemed to enjoy sending me off.
The corridor was, of course, dark and silent because the lights were off.
Now... where should I start looking?
Wandering aimlessly wouldn't be efficient.
There are two possible reasons why Yamamura, who is not the type to break basic rules, left the shared room: either he was called out by someone, or he left the room voluntarily. However, in this case, the possibility of the former is quite low because he left his mobile phone behind.
I proceed with the assumption that he left voluntarily.
The next thing to consider is why it had to be after lights-out, why it had to be later.
In contrast to the silence of the surroundings at night, countless distracting thoughts flood into my mind.
Sometimes I might want to run away from that.
And at that time, it's not strange to unconsciously seek a place where I can feel at ease.
The conclusion that the student named Yamamura Miki's thoughts would lead to. If I were to derive that---
I quietly showed my face in the lobby.
Immediately after, I felt the presence of someone and hid in the shadows.
It seems that a patrolling teacher is walking around here with a flashlight.
The visibility is poor, but it's easy to see where the light is shining.
He thoroughly illuminates the surroundings, but he doesn't seem to be looking for a rule-breaking student who has escaped from the shared room.
He's just doing it as part of his job, as if he's doing it out of obligation.
Therefore, it was very easy to get past him, and the presence of people disappeared from the lobby as soon as I waited a little. It seems he went to check the dining hall.
Considering the route, he must have gone to either the shared room or the experiential classroom afterwards.

For a while, I had some respite. I headed straight to the vending machine without hesitation.
I had a hunch that the odds were high, and I was able to confirm my guess immediately.
There wasn't a girl sitting alone, she was leaning against the vending machine, looking down.
The hallway was chilly, so she might be trying to keep warm---but that might be reading too much into it. I thought she might notice me eventually, but she didn't seem to be aware of my presence at all.
She didn't change her expression as if remembering something, nor did she sigh. 
She just stared at a single point on the floor, not moving at all.
"The teachers probably don't even think there's a student here."
I couldn't just keep watching her, so I decided to call out to her.
"Ah...eh!?"
Yamamura, who was startled, turned her face towards me.
Her eyes were filled with fear, but as soon as she realized it was me, that fear disappeared.
"Why...why are you here...?"
"They'll get mad if they find you. I came to take you back before that happens."
"I was confident that...I wouldn't be found...but if Ayanokōji-kun found me, I can't use that excuse, can I..."
Indeed, Yamamura could probably avoid the teachers' surveillance and even return to the shared room.
"...How did you...notice I was gone?"
"There's no special reason. I just noticed Hiyori was gone and she told me. She was worried."
"I'm sorry...I just, really wanted to be alone..."
"In a shared room, you can't be alone unless you lock yourself in the bathroom."
She nodded slightly, indicating that she understood.
"Can I...stay here a little longer...?"
"Do you have to be next to the vending machine?"
"Yes. When I listen to the sound of the vending machine, the unnecessary voices in my mind disappear..."
This behavior seemed to be a standard way for Yamamura to protect herself.
"So, there's no other place. So? Did the unnecessary voices disappear?"
"Why...why are you asking that...?"
"If they don't disappear and I take you back, you might run away again. Besides---I hate to say it, but it didn't look like it was working."
"Usually, they stop hearing immediately and it's resolved...usually..."
In other words, it's different now. From Yamamura's downcast expression, I could tell something serious was going on.
"If you have something bothering you, you should try saying it."
"...No. I'm fine."
"Really? I've been watching Yamamura here for about 5 minutes, and I didn't get that impression at all."
"5...5 minutes!? Really...!?"
"Sorry, I lied. It was about 30 seconds."
The fact that she didn't doubt even an arbitrary number of minutes suggests that she wasn't aware of her surroundings.
"Do you not like talking about your troubles with others?"
"It's not about liking or disliking, I just...don't have that kind of experience..."
Even without much conversation, it's not hard to imagine Yamamura's life.
She probably spent a lot of time alone from a young age, and spent more time with her mouth closed than open.
Even though our circumstances and situations are very different, I can tell that we had similar experiences.
"I'm not good at talking either. If there's a small problem, I tend to keep it to myself or try to solve it. So I rarely have the opportunity to consult with someone about my troubles."
"You too, Ayanokōji-kun. But to me...you seem normal. You seem to have a lot of friends. And Shiina-san too. She's bright and cute...I'm jealous..."
If you only look at the present, it's probably not unreasonable to feel that way.
But everyone has had an immature side in the past that is different from now.
"Do you know what I was like in the relatively early days of the year before last?"
She probably wasn't helping Sakayanagi at the time, so she wouldn't know.
"...Now that you mention it...I don't know anything."
"Right? So the only thing that's certain is that I wasn't a student who left an impression on many people. Fortunately, I was pulled along by my lively classmates and was able to build some relationships, but they weren't ones I had prepared myself."

"But why did you become like this now?"
"I'm not in a good relationship with those around me, but at least in these two years, I've started to try to close the distance little by little. I think that's had an impact. I've started to be able to say what I want to say since then."
Yamamura still couldn't understand it.
"I'm---probably scared. Of voicing my thoughts. And of those thoughts spreading unintentionally. I'm scared of being known..."
Yamamura's style until now had been the opposite.
Picking up other people's thoughts in secret and passing them on to a third party.
It's not unreasonable to feel a strong resistance to becoming the known from the knower.
"I won't force you. You should judge for yourself."
Without making her too conscious, I slowly sat down in front of the vending machine, leaving some distance.
The slight vibration of the vending machine and the sound of the fan that I could feel through my back.
Yamamura is not the only one who fears loneliness.
Whether it's Yōsuke, Kei, Ryūen, Sakayanagi, or any other student, human nature is the same.
Unable to bear loneliness, they can't live alone.
That's why those who stand by you for free are important.
Even though I don't feel it applies to me, I understand that it's one answer.
The contradiction it contains.
No, that fact doesn't matter now.
Yamamura in front of me is not foolish.
She's not seeking loneliness, nor does she think loneliness is right.
If there's someone who can offer a proper helping hand, she won't make a mistake.
"---Can I talk to you?"
Yamamura, sensing no hostility, said so and began to voice the part she had been holding back.
"Since the last special exam ended, I've had one question in my mind..."
It was about the details of what happened in Class A during the special survival and dropout exam.
In a situation where defeat was certain and a dropout had to be chosen, Sakayanagi chose to draw lots. No matter how you decide, there will be pros and cons.
Since everyone's abilities are not the same, there will always be those who are dissatisfied, whether you name them or play rock-paper-scissors.
To Sakayanagi, who sees all students other than herself as equals, the lottery was probably the most equitable decision.
However, she must now realize that it was a mistake.
Even if she is disliked by those around her, she should have kept the personnel that were convenient for her.
If Kamuro had stayed, Sakayanagi's weakness would not have been exposed.
But Sakayanagi wasn't the only one who was hurt.
This Yamamura was standing on one side of the scales that separated the final two choices in the lottery, life and death.
"When I hesitated to draw a lot, Sakayanagi-san said she would stop the lottery. If you don't have the courage to draw a lot, it's the same as abstaining..."
If she refused to draw for a long time, it's certainly a choice she could make.
But Yamamura felt that it was too quick a judgment to call it a long thought.
"Did Sakayanagi value Kamuro and try to cut you off?"
Yamamura quietly nodded. It was not just a guess, but Yamamura's conviction.
"I strongly felt that Sakayanagi-san wanted me to withdraw at that moment."
And she continued.
"I understand that it can't be helped. At least, when comparing me and Kamuro-san, the value was clear. I didn't wish to be treated specially. I didn't even want to be greedy and wish to be considered a friend. But... I was shocked to know that my existence was something that could be discarded in an instant... even though she used me saying I was a valuable person..."
Sakayanagi had found Yamamura, who had always been alone, and highly valued her ability. However, when she weighed her against Kamuro, she realized that the difference between the two was so great that it wasn't even a contest.
In the end, she knew Kamuro would be chosen, but she thought she would hesitate.
Her small wish to belittle herself was mercilessly denied.
"Sakayanagi may indeed have seen a difference between Kamuro and Yamamura. But whether she thinks Yamamura is irrelevant or not, isn't that a separate issue?"
"...I want to believe that. But..."
She probably hasn't had any contact from Sakayanagi since that day.
So she must have been questioning herself all this time.
"I've been thinking about contacting Sakayanagi-san during this camp. But, I couldn't muster the courage, I couldn't call out to her..."

Although he had spotted her several times, it seemed he had never managed to speak to her. It must have been a considerable hurdle for Yamamura, who usually waits to be spoken to.
"Many more people were clinging to her than I thought. It was tough for Tokitō-kun to get involved in trouble among them," Yamamura told me. He had tried to reach out to the listless Sakayanagi.
However, he had been called to the experience class and questioned because he had been seen doing so.
"As a result, Tokitō-kun was... forcibly restrained and threatened by Ryūen-kun and his group."
It was probably an appropriate decision for the Ryūen side, which was tense in preparation for the end-of-year exams.
If the opponent they were going to fight in the future was unexpectedly weak, they should either leave them alone or weaken them further. Although some parts were too radical to ignore.
They seemed to be planning to take the next end-of-year exam in perfect condition, with their antennas up high.
For Ryūen, who is confirmed to compete with Sakayanagi in the end-of-year exam, it is natural to think that he does not want to stimulate and revive her.
He seemed desperate to take advantage of the situation where he had been tripped up by an unexpected defeat.
In other words, it was proof that Sakayanagi was an opponent who could not be underestimated and had no weaknesses.
The purge of Tokitō in the flow of things was expected to end quickly, but Hōsen and Utomiya from the same group as Tokitō joined in, and there was a risk of a brawl. It seems that the situation was resolved when the number of students who heard the commotion increased all at once and they dispersed.
"But I'm impressed. You watched the whole thing and no one noticed?"
"That's all I can do..."
As a role to gather information using his unobtrusiveness, Yamamura was indeed the right person.
The skill of Sakayanagi, who quickly identified and utilized his ability, was impressive once again.
This time, Yamamura was able to witness the scene because she herself was concerned about Sakayanagi.
Indeed, Sakayanagi is now on a downward slope.
"What do you want to do?"
"Huh...?"
"As a classmate and as someone who is likely to be abandoned by Sakayanagi, what do you want me to do?"
"I, um..."
"I want to hear your feelings."
"I have... two wishes. One is... I want to know what you thought of me at that time, and what you think of me now. "
"And the other one?"
"... I think... Sakayanagi-san doesn't suit losing... I don't want to see her struggle in the end-of-year exam... I hope she wins."
There was Yamamura, who was worried about a student purely, without any personal calculation of wanting her to win because she was in class A.
"I see---yes."
Sakayanagi might need a little push. And soon.
"Why don't you try telling her? No one has the right to condemn your actions."
"What if... what if... she doesn't even want to listen to my story...?"
"In that case, let's say, I'll get stuck in between some vending machines and listen to your consultation."
When I told her that, Yamamura looked at the vending machine a little shyly and nodded.
1
It was just before 1 a.m. on the fourth day of the training camp.
Long past lights-out, Nagumo was quietly walking down the hallway alone.
He knew he would get a little warning if he was found, but there was no clear penalty.
Of course, this is not the case if he resists, such as not returning to his room after being found.
Considering the risk, he had already proven it with other students the day before.
Above all, he had investigated that the teachers' patrols would end at the time the date changed.
Therefore, Nagumo was hardly worried about being found.
The lights in the lobby were kept to a minimum, and only the sound of the compressors of the lined-up vending machines reached his ears annoyingly at such a time.
He passed through the lobby and moved on to the cafeteria area, where no one was supposed to be.
He couldn't feel anyone's presence, but his intuition was working.
She's right in front of me, he thought.
"You came as promised."
From the back of the darkened cafeteria, such a cute voice reached him.

"I've never refused a woman's call before," he spoke into the darkness.
"Yawn, what a cheesy line. Honestly, I hate your type."
"Suit yourself, Kokoro. I'm not a fan of women like you either."
Nagumo, who snorted in amusement, stepped into the cafeteria with his hands still in his pockets.
"So, there was no need to threaten me. It might have been an unnecessary move."
As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, a female student emerged.
"Amasawa, did you really want to be alone with me that much?"
"Opportunities to be alone with a former student council president don't come around often, do they?"
"I want to confirm something, what would you have done if I hadn't come?"
"I would have beaten up your precious Asahina-senpai, Nagumo-senpai."
Many would have laughed off Amasawa's response as a joke, seeing her smiling face.
And Nagumo did the same, but his eyes weren't laughing. He was convinced that the first-year student in front of him would have carried out her threat.
"Did you show your skills in archery with Ayanokōji to make your threats more effective?"
"Well, yeah. If I don't show that I'm capable, people might dismiss a woman's threats."
"Okay, let's get to the point. So, why did you threaten me to call me out?"
"There's a problem that can't be solved unless it's you, Nagumo-senpai. That's what I want to talk about."
"You had plenty of chances to talk during the mixer."
While responding, Nagumo braced himself internally.
He sensed that the girl in front of him was not just any girl, her presence was faint.
A student with a strange atmosphere, similar to Ayanokōji.
And the owner of an unusual ability that he had glimpsed during the archery match.
That was more than enough to put him on guard.
"By the way, I'm thinking of seriously injuring you, Nagumo-senpai."
"Seriously injuring me? That's quite sudden."
Amasawa, who was trying to enjoy Nagumo's surprise at the unexpected proposal, laughed in disbelief.
"Is it too unrealistic? Or do you think you can't lose to a girl?"
"I wonder. Maybe it's both."
"Will you run away?"
In this situation, Amasawa used her words to corner Nagumo, to make sure he wouldn't escape.
A measure to prevent the former student council president from running away like a scared rabbit.
But Nagumo's demeanor was confident, showing no signs of worry.
"Can I at least hear the reason?"
"The reason? Hmm, let's just say it's my personal vendetta."
"Personal vendetta, huh?"
"Yes, a personal vendetta. Now, if we take too long, the teachers might find us, and it would be embarrassing if the fact that you were beaten by a girl got out, so can we start?"
"Just to confirm, do you really think you can beat me?"
"Haha, I've been waiting for you to say that. Let's give it a try."
"It's easy to say, but there's no benefit for me. It would be a problem if I retaliated against a girl who came at me out of personal vendetta."
"It's pointless to resist anyway, you can just let me beat you up. That way, you'll lose your pride, but you won't get penalized by the school. I recommend it."
"Aren't you afraid of being expelled?"
"Of course not. If I get expelled, I have nothing to lose."
"So, persuasion is impossible?"
"Yes, I have no 'value'. In other words, I'm invincible."
Nagumo slowly pulled his hands out of his pockets.
If he had been holding his cell phone, Amasawa would have immediately jumped on him to prevent him from calling for help.
"I didn't bring my cell phone."
"Oh..."

Amasawa had slightly licked her own lips.
"Did you get cautious because of the recording? Answer without hesitation, the reason for your so-called outburst."
"You teamed up with Ayanokōjisenpai and expelled Yagami Takuya, right? It's payback."
Nagumo had been considering various things, but he was completely surprised by the unexpected.
"Yagami? Don't tell me, you were Yagami's girlfriend?"
"That's not it, but we were like siblings who had surpassed such a relationship."
"Then isn't your target wrong? I wasn't the one who led that."
"I know that. I told you, this is just an outburst. Unfortunately, even if I stand on my head, I can't beat Ayanokōjisenpai, and I thought about beating up Karuizawasenpai and expelling her, but that's a bit scary."
"Scary? Of getting payback from Ayanokōji? I think he doesn't care what happens to Karuizawa."
"Ayanokōjisenpai has his own goals. I don't want to interfere with that."
By expelling Karuizawa, it would interfere with Ayanokōji's plan.
As someone who knew the circumstances, Amasawa thought she couldn't do that.
"People like Nagumosenpai, it suits the story's punchline for them to fall in the end."
"It suits me, huh."
If he was usually told such words, Nagumo would have felt dissatisfaction, anger.
But now, emptiness welled up before such emotions.
Thinking it was a waste to spend any more time, Amasawa stepped forward.
"Last year and the year before, the one always causing a stir at this school was Horikita Manabu."
But an unexpected story began, and she stopped.
"This year it's Ayanokōji. I'm sure it'll be the same next year after I'm gone. I was indeed enrolled at this school for three years. I also served as student council president. Even if I attracted attention in the same grade, it didn't resonate at all with the upper or lower grades. There's nothing more empty than that."
That's why he desperately continued to challenge the game.
"I realized it just before graduation. It's not Horikitasenpai or Ayanokōji who's bad. It's me who couldn't reach that realm."
That's why he couldn't get angry when told it suited him to fall.
If Nagumo had a stronger power.
The names of Horikita, Nagumo, and Ayanokōji should have been equal.
He realized that there was no need to seek black and white in a game, they were on par.
"But---that's not the essence. I wouldn't have been satisfied with that situation either."
If the three of them were lined up, he would still want to rank them and be number one.
"That's why I won't quit the game. Next year I'll do it again with Horikitasenpai. And someday I'll have a real game with Ayanokōji and settle it."
A part of him could be honest because he was talking to Amasawa, who had nothing to do with him.
Although he didn't say it, Nagumo was grateful for this situation.
"Before you put it into action, I have a gift for you."
Amasawa, who had never been interested before, was intrigued by Nagumo who had laid everything bare.
So she stopped and listened to the end.
"A gift? I'm the type to throw away presents from men I'm not interested in without opening them."
"I see. Then it might end with you throwing it away without opening it. After all, it's just a message from Ayanokōji."
"...Ayanokōjisenpai...?"
Her body stiffened involuntarily at the sound of his name.
"If it's a lie to save yourself, it will only widen the wound."
"Believe my words or not, it's up to you. The message from Ayanokōji is 'You still have value. Don't waste it.'"
The reason Amasawa approached Nagumo at the exchange meeting was all for this moment of payback.
Ayanokōji had noticed Amasawa's suspicious points from the first day.
Despite having all the information from Tsukishiro beforehand, she pretended not to know the rules of the exchange meeting. The contradiction caused by the lie she told to prevent her real reason for approaching Nagumo from being discovered.
The moment she heard such a message, Amasawa completely lost her will to fight.
"Is this just a coincidence? The message seems to have foreseen even the fact that you would despairingly declare yourself 'worthless'."
The fact that Amasawa was targeting Nagumo, and that she would take drastic actions because she had nothing to lose.
What he had been told at the time of parting actually happened right in front of Nagumo.
He's a guy I don't like. Nagumo cursed in his heart.

Yet, Nagumo felt a slight sense of satisfaction.
Now, it would be a waste to seriously fight with Ayanokōji.
"I'm tired, so I'm going back first. You should return to your room before you catch a cold."
Nagumo left the dining hall, leaving Amasawa standing still.
〇The Courage to Step Forward
It was Sunday, the fourth day of the training camp. Today was the day to say goodbye to the familiar campsite. We had to leave the accommodation at 10 o'clock.
The game with Amasawa was set for 7 o'clock before breakfast.
Before 6 o'clock, after waking up, I came to the still dimly lit lobby.
I had some time to spare until Horikita and Ibuki showed up from their shared room, and I looked at my phone to kill time, considering the risk of waking up sleeping students.
The lobby was chilly and cold, perhaps because the heating had just been turned on.
"It seems everything is fine."
In the silent corridor, I muttered to myself while looking at my phone screen. The only message left from Nagumo, which had arrived in the middle of the night, was 'I won't say thank you.'
If Amasawa had committed a crime, the rest of the camp would have been a big fuss.
After a while, as I watched the sun rise through the glass, I heard footsteps.
"Morning is really early, isn't it?"
The one who approached me with a sleepy voice was Tsubaki from the same group.
It's a pretty high probability if it's just a coincidence---
"For the past two days, I heard from Hashimotosenpai that Ayanokōjisenpai gets up early in the morning."
There's no need to hide going out in the morning, so the impact of being asked about it is minimal.
Even if Tsubaki noticed the special training, the probability of the information reaching Amasawa is not that high.
"So, you came looking for me?"
"Not so much looking for you, but I just thought I'd check if you were here."
Tsubaki, who doesn't change her attitude towards anyone, looks at me with a slightly suspicious look.
"But if you were here, the story would change a bit."
"I don't think there's any reason for you to come see me anymore."
"The special test given only to first-year students has been canceled."
A student who expelled me would be given 20 million private points.
That was a phantom special test known only to a few, as Tsukishiro was involved.
"I wasn't interested in the prize money from the start. But I'm disappointed. I'm lamenting the loss of the right to expel Ayanokōjisenpai in a dignified manner."
"That's a dangerous talk. I don't remember ever being resented by Tsubaki."
I look back on my school life, but of course, there's nothing to worry about.
"Don't you think there are more things you don't realize? People unknowingly incur resentment, don't you think?"
I can understand what Tsubaki is trying to say. There are people who know they are resented and are resented, and there are people who don't think they are resented but are resented.
"I don't know if you're joking or serious."
"Someone might come here, so why don't we take a walk?"
"It's still dark outside."
It's getting a bit brighter, but the visibility is still poor and it's quite cold.
"If it's not inconvenient for you."
"Well, okay."
Anyway, I was planning to go outside to accompany Horikita and Ibuki for their final special training.
Then the two of us left the lobby and started walking outside in the cold.
"I thought it would be snowing quite a bit in the mountains of Tochigi, but it's not as much as I thought."
"February has a drastic temperature difference. Maybe it's because we've had a few warm days recently."
In fact, it's not completely snow-free, and there's a little bit of snow left on the side of the road. The water droplets on the cars, presumably belonging to the staff here, are slightly frozen and covered with a thin film.
"Do you like snow, senpai?"
"I don't particularly like or dislike it. I just think it's enjoyable as a landscape when it falls. Do you like snow, Tsubaki?"
"---I guess I do. At least more than senpai."
She squatted down on the side of the road, picked up a little bit of the remaining snow with her fingertips, and stood up.

And she placed snow on her palm and showed it to me.
"Can you look at this?"
When she asked, I stared at the snow on her palm.
Because it was a small amount, it melted and disappeared quickly due to the warmth of her palm.
"Being in this school feels like being cut off from the outside world, doesn't it? Who do you want to see first when you graduate next year, senpai?"
"You ask strange questions."
"Maybe."
For me, the only people I know more than by face in the outside world are my father and his associates.
I don't have any one-sided feelings of wanting to see any of them.
"Probably just my family."
So I chose a safe answer that wouldn't surprise anyone.
"Family... Anyone else?"
"Not really. I don't have any close friends, so that's about it."
"I see... Then, can I ask you one more strange question?"
Tsubaki kept asking questions that seemed to have meaning and yet didn't.
"If Ayanokōjisenpai had a brother, and you didn't know about his existence because it was hidden from you by your parents for years. But one day, you were told he was your real family, would you be able to love him as a family member? Of course, assuming there is a genuine blood connection."
"That's a difficult question."
As far as I know, I don't have any siblings.
But, this is a hypothetical situation where it was hidden, so it's possible in reality.
If that man had a son other than me... I wonder how I would feel when I met him.
I was interested in the thought for the first time, but that doesn't mean I felt any unexpected emotions.
"I might not feel anything. Of course, I think it would greatly depend on the other person's personality and situation."
If we were raised completely separately, it would be difficult to suddenly accept and interact with him as a family member.
"I see. I think I would probably feel the same way as Ayanokōjisenpai. But, if I knew that the other person had a special circumstance and a sad past, I would feel the urge to get closer to them. I would want to know more about my sister, who I had been separated from."
She had asked me about a brother, but Tsubaki used a sister as an example. It's normal to think she was comparing it to the same gender, but the way she expressed her emotions sounded like it was based on her own experience.
"I'm torn. I want to tell Ayanokōjisenpai about this school---"
Just as she was about to say that, Tsubaki's gaze shifted to the building behind us.
It was because the promised time was approaching and Horikita and Ibuki appeared.
And for some reason, Kushida was also there.
"We've been interrupted... Let's talk again later."
Tsubaki seemed to have no intention of letting the other students hear her story, and she returned to the building, shivering from the cold.
She nodded lightly to Horikita and the others as they passed by, but she didn't say anything.
"That was Tsubaki-san, right? What were you talking about at this hour?"
"She said she woke up early. The training camp is over today, so we were just chatting. But why is Kushida here?"
"Ibuki-san here carelessly leaked about her rematch with Amasawa-san. Carelessly."
She emphasized the word 'carelessly' twice, expressing how foolish it was.
"It's not my fault! It's Kushida's fault for tricking me into it!"
"That's what you call being defiant."
"Shut up! It doesn't matter if there's one or two more spectators!"
"So that's it. I heard that you're going to fight with Amasawa-san, and I got interested."
"If both of you agree, I have nothing to say, but who are you cheering for?"
My personal interest lies there.
"For me, it's like a win-win situation no matter who loses."
She seemed to have had a dispute with Amasawa during the cultural festival.
In other words, no matter who wins or loses, it will be a satisfying match for Kushida.
Kushida looked back at Tsubaki, who had already disappeared from sight.
"About Tsubaki-san earlier, was it about love? I've been thinking for a while, but Ayanokōji-kun, you're surprisingly popular, aren't you?"
"Is that so?"

Tsubaki's goal was completely different, but it seemed Kushida had assumed such.
In sync with that, Horikita also opened her mouth.
"But you're aware of it, right? You're dating Karuizawa-san after all."
"On the contrary, do you have confidence in being popular?"
"Why me? I'm not popular."
"At least Sudō has shown you favor, hasn't he?"
"Really? Horikita? Haha, you'd make a good match with that idiot."
"Stop calling Sudō-kun an idiot. He's become several times smarter than you now."
"But I can knock him down with my kick!"
I didn't understand why the comparison had become a fight, but if they were serious, Sudō would probably be stronger.
"Well, but---"
After looking at me from top to bottom, Ibuki spat out forcefully.
"I don't understand why this guy is popular at all."
It was the first time I had seen someone hold such a small 't' in their words.
"You feel the same way, don't you, Kushida?"
"Eh?"
"Not 'eh?'. I'm asking, you don't understand Ayanokōji's appeal, do you?"
"...Well. It's not that he doesn't have any appeal, right? If you look around, you can see that there are no decent men, right? Compared to such riffraff, he might look better."
It seemed like a compliment, but probably not.
"I think they're the same to me...!"
"Then, if you had to date either Ryūen-kun or Ayanokōji-kun, who would you choose, Ibuki-san?"
At Kushida's question, Ibuki fell silent for a while, maintaining a puzzled expression.
Eventually, she broke the silence and came to a conclusion.
"I can't choose between curry-flavored shit and shit-flavored curry."
Horikita and Kushida quickly distanced themselves from Ibuki to avoid getting involved.
No one wants to hear such a topic in a loud voice.
If I ran away, she would probably chase after me, so I had no choice but to become a human shield.
"What kind of comparison is that?"
I decided to retort for the time being.
"What do you mean, what kind? It's just as it is."
I didn't mind any analogy, but that comparison hurt a bit.
And I wondered whether I was the former or the latter.
No, I don't want to be either.
But---I deliberately thought about it.
If I had to eat one of them, I would choose the latter.
Even if the taste was corrected, it would be extremely dangerous to ingest a large amount of E. coli. On the other hand, the latter would cause great damage to the taste and smell, but the raw material is still curry. In other words, the adverse effects on the human body should be greatly limited.
However, if the brain judges it as dangerous from the smell, there is a possibility of unexpected health damage...
"What's wrong, Ayanokōji? You're spacing out."
"It's nothing..."
I thought too deeply and felt a little unwell, so I decided to forget about it.
1
Today, there is a rematch right after this, so the special training is finished with just a warm-up.
"We've done what we can. Now it's up to how well it works in the actual game."
Without taking much time, I called out to the two of them as their breathing calmed down.
"Yes, thank you. Thanks to you, our chances have increased."
Horikita, who bowed her head politely, urged Ibuki to thank her as well.
Whether she had no intention of following suit, Ibuki turned away and snorted.
"I won't say thank you. I think my way of thanking you is to kick you someday."

"If that's your idea of gratitude, I don't want it in the future."
"Really..."
"Well, I'll go back first, so do your best."
"Eh? Aren't you going to watch, Ayanokōji-kun? I thought we were going to watch together."
Kushida, who had been watching from a distance, seemed to think we would be together all the time.
"If it's revealed that I'm involved in this matter, it will only harm Horikita and Ibuki."
If I make Amasawa suspicious, the surprise attack won't work.
To increase the odds of winning by even 1%, it's better not to be present.
"I see. Then I'll make sure to watch. I brought my cell phone too."
She probably thinks it's a photo opportunity if there's an embarrassing scene.
Since Kushida declared that she would be the witness, I decided to leave that role to her.
Besides, I had one more thing to do this morning.
Just before 7 o'clock, naturally, there were hardly any students using the park at this time.
That's why the student I had called here was sitting on a bench, waiting for me to arrive.
"It's cold, isn't it? You didn't have to come earlier than the promised time."
"Don't worry about it. I don't get many opportunities to be called out by you, Ayanokōji-kun. I enjoyed waiting."
"Can I sit next to you?"
"I've kept it open for that purpose."
Sakayanagi, who was smiling, welcomed me as usual.
"I'll get straight to the point. I've got Yamamura waiting in the dog run area."
"Eh? Dog run? Yamamura-san? What do you mean?"
"Didn't you expect Yamamura's name to come up?"
"She was in the same group as you at the exchange meeting, wasn't she? Did she do something problematic?"
Pretending not to know, Sakayanagi made up a reason.
"You knew it. That Yamamura and I were in the same group."
"That's a surprise. Of course, I had already figured out which group each student in the class was assigned to when we got on the bus. I was just observing this time, so I didn't touch the exchange meeting."
Of course, I knew that Sakayanagi had figured out where all of her classmates were assigned.
So, once I tell her what I'm about to say, Sakayanagi won't be able to escape.
"On the second day of the camp, when we talked in the lobby, do you remember what you said? 'Hashimoto-kun and Morishita-san are in the same group. How is Hashimoto-kun doing?' That's what you said. You, who prides yourself on not missing where the A-class students are assigned, didn't even mention Yamamura's name, did you?"
This proves that Sakayanagi was unconsciously avoiding the topic of Yamamura.
"That's---"
No matter what excuse she makes, she can't twist the conclusion that she 'avoided' it.
"...Yes, that's right. I admit that I didn't mention Yamamura-san's name at that time. But it's none of your business, is it, Ayanokōji-kun?"
"Indeed, it's none of my business. What I'm trying to do now is probably meddling."
But I continue. Sakayanagi knows everything, so I don't beat around the bush.
"You lost Kamuro. And at the same time, you were entrusted with her feelings. But that doesn't mean everything is back to normal. You haven't even finished choosing who to keep by your side, have you?"
White breath leaks from the lips of Sakayanagi, who is sitting next to me.
"Indeed, I haven't decided yet, but are you suggesting that I should make Yamamura-san the one?"
"I don't mean that. People have their strengths and weaknesses."
The image of Yamamura boldly supporting Sakayanagi is hard to imagine.
"There are still students who are trapped in that place from the special test of survival and dropout."
"...Are you saying that's me and Yamamura-san?"
"That's right. Yamamura is suffering and stuck, even though her situation is very different from yours."
The two who haven't finished the special test of survival and dropout.
If Sakayanagi is the light of Class A, Yamamura is the shadow.
It's safe to say they have an inseparable relationship that can't be cut off.
"If you're still bothered by that, you should resolve it."
"...You're saying something strange, Ayanokōji-kun."

"A strange thing?"
"I thought you were just going to stand by from now on. Isn't your unnecessary intervention too much?"
"That's right. I also thought until a little while ago that I should just stand by from here on."
Sakayanagi no longer needed any further assistance.
It was enough to wait for her to stand up on her own.
However, the situation had significantly changed since before the special test when Hashimoto decided to betray.
That's why I'm doing what I think I need to do now.
"I don't particularly want you to have anything to do with Yamamura. I don't have any such hopes at all. Whether you want to get closer or further away, or even break up, it's up to you. But if you're going to talk, now is the only time."
There's no benefit to either side in postponing this issue.
"Isn't it the wisest choice to leave everything behind at this training camp and go home?"
"...But..."
Sakayanagi's annoying resistance.
I'm not one to talk, but she's just as bad at friendships.
She doesn't know what to do because she has no experience.
"As I said earlier, I have Yamamura waiting in the dog run. She's been waiting for you in the cold for over 20 minutes now."
"If that's the case, aren't we being mean, Ayanokōji-kun? The time I promised to meet her is 7 o'clock. We haven't even been talking for 10 minutes yet. Doesn't that mean she's been waiting since before that?"
From Yamamura's perspective, she's been made to wait unnecessarily early and is having a hard time.
From Sakayanagi's perspective, she would be overwhelmed by guilt for making Yamamura wait.
"This is also part of my strategy."
Sakayanagi, who quickly notices these kinds of things, is indeed Sakayanagi.
"I guess there's no choice. I can't let her catch a cold because of me. Let's go pick her up for now."
Sakayanagi, who can't admit her weakness straight away, stood up with a suitable reason.
That's fine here.
If she talks one-on-one with Yamamura, they should be able to talk honestly.
"It's a bit of a distance, but even Sakayanagi can walk there in about 5 minutes. Go ahead."
I also stood up and told her so.
However---Sakayanagi didn't take a step.
"What's wrong?"
My question was met with silence, and a brief silence ensued.
Even during that time, Sakayanagi tried to start walking, but she didn't move forward at all.
"...My... leg..."
Her leg? Could it be hurting? I thought for a moment, but...
"My leg... I can't move it... I wonder why."
It was immediately clear that it was not a physical problem, but a mental one.
Even though she acts bravely in words as usual, her body doesn't seem to agree.
It seems that the change in her heart that Kamuro made her aware of is also appearing here.
"I can't show this side of me to anyone else."
"...Yes, that's right..."
I grabbed Sakayanagi's left hand, which was confused and unable to walk.
Having waited for me earlier, her fingertips were very cold.
"Then, just for now, I'll be your legs. That should make it easy for you to walk."
"...I'm sorry."
"It's okay. It's my own meddling that started this."
After that, we moved forward slowly without exchanging words.
Eventually, the dog run came into view.
Seeing Yamamura standing in the shadow of the >>>big tree<<< in the distance, Sakayanagi raised her hand slowly to make her presence known, despite her confusion. When I gently pushed her back, she started walking on her own, albeit with a cane.
From here on, it's not my place to interfere.
Sakayanagi and Yamamura will have to talk and find their own solutions.

Expecting a bright future, I turned my back and left the place.
Thus, the three-night, four-day exchange meeting came to an end.
〇Who is the Challenger?
With the end of the exchange meeting that brought changes in human relationships, the usual school life resumed.
Recently, it had become customary for me to meet up with Kei in the room or lobby every morning and go to school, but today was different. I left the room alone, about 20 minutes earlier than usual.
I got off the elevator, went down to the lobby, and then went outside.
It was unusually cold today, perhaps because of the strong wind.
Soon, February would be over.
Next month would be busier than ever.
First, I had to deal with the issue concerning Karuizawa Kei.
Nothing special was needed for this.
I just needed to proceed with the process as originally planned.
Next, the issue concerning Ichinose Honami.
The leader of a class that was struggling to compete with the other three classes, with nothing outstanding among the four classes.
My prediction was correct, and D class was in decline as the end of the second year approached.
However... unlike Kei's problem, some adjustments might be needed.
I could make a decision after the end-of-year exam results were out.
No matter how much Ichinose grew, there would be no major changes.
I thought I just needed to proceed with the plan as I originally intended.
But---
One problem arose that was not in the plan.
This forced me to make changes to my plan.
There would be some negative effects as a result, but not all changes were bad.
As soon as I started walking to school, I stopped.
"You're early."
I spotted the person I was meeting up with in my field of vision.
There was still some time until the scheduled time, but they were already waiting.
They didn't notice me and occasionally exhaled white breath as if they were cold, but soon they noticed my gaze.
"Good morning, Ayanokōji-kun."
As I approached, a morning greeting came flying.
"Good morning. Sorry for calling you out so early."
"It's okay. So, what do you want to talk to me about? Something hard to tell over the phone?"
We knew each other's contact information as classmates. Normally, we could communicate with just a mobile phone.
I was questioned about why I didn't do that.
"In a way, maybe."
Horikita lined up next to me and soon started walking in step.
"In a way? That's a scary way to put it."
"There's nothing to be wary of."
"Really?"
She looked at me with doubtful eyes, but there was no prickliness like when we first met.
It was a natural friendship, with a softness that could be described as such.
"I often talk to Horikita about special exams and class-related matters. But sometimes I want to talk about things that have nothing to do with that."
"Huh? Sorry, I don't understand. What do you mean?"
I regretted that my words were clumsier than I had imagined.
I had thought of a more casual way to say it, but I decided against it because it might bother her depending on how she took it.
"I wanted to have a meaningless conversation with Horikita, unrelated to our interests. Does that make sense to you?"
"...I see?"
She seemed to think for a moment, but apparently, she didn't understand.

"I finally became classmates with Horikita. It's not like we'll have the opportunity to talk forever."
"Forever is an exaggeration. Sure, that's true, but we still have over a year until graduation, right? We don't have to arrange meetings like this, I can chat anytime."
"What if I were to be expelled at the end of the school year exam?"
"That's a leap. I don't think you'll be expelled. But seeing how easily you get common sense questions wrong, maybe there's a possibility..."
After answering seriously, she laughed a little, finding her own words amusing.
"Are you really worried that you might be expelled? Is that why you wanted to talk so early in the morning...?"
"The last special exam has become a bit of a trauma for me."
"Then why don't you try to remember more common sense questions? You're good at studying."
She retorted, knowing my weak points.
"So, can Horikita remember game and anime terms as easily as studying?"
"Huh? ...I wonder. When >>>Onizuka<<< tried to push a game on me before, he was talking about DP... something, DEF something, cooldown something, but my brain refused to remember those words and their meanings..."
"It's a similar feeling. I just can't seem to want to remember it."
I intended to be eager to absorb knowledge, but I also had such preferences.
"Don't worry. From a class perspective, your existence is essential. Even if you struggle with common sense questions, I'll always back you up. In other words, you won't be expelled."
Horikita said that, clearly.
"That's reassuring."
Horikita, who had been seriously interacting, was lightly tapped on the shoulder with a chop from my left hand.
"Do you really worry about your own expulsion? It doesn't seem like it. What's the real issue?"
"Actually, I'm not worried about myself, but about the possibility of Horikita being expelled."
"That seems more likely in reality."
She showed a slightly annoyed face, but it didn't seem serious and she quickly returned to normal.
Compared to when she first entered, Horikita's emotions have become much more varied.
"The last special exam resulted in only Kamuro being expelled. However, next time it might be more."
"...You're expecting new dropouts."
"Yeah. At least one from the grade. Depending on the content and development, several people might disappear."
"...That many?"
"It's better to think that way. The school has said before, our second year students are progressing through school life with no or few dropouts."
"So they're going to force an exam to increase the number of dropouts? That's... a bit tyrannical. Our grade didn't have that many gaps. It should have been a good thing."
If you look at it positively, that's true.
But sometimes, a sieve is needed forcibly.
"It depends on how it looks from the outside. For example, the government is also involved in the operation of this school. If the goal is to drop 10 people a year, our second year students didn't meet that standard. It would be nice if they simply accepted us as an excellent generation, but it's unknown how much the people at the top are aware of and acknowledge these detailed numbers."
"To comply with the government's policy, they'll tighten the guidance?"
"Last year, they forcibly changed 0 to 1 because there were no dropouts. I wouldn't be surprised if several people were expelled in the special end-of-year exam."
The winter break advice from the third year students. That might not have been just for the special survival and dropout exam. But in reality, the third year students probably don't know about the future of the second year students.
"Isn't that overthinking...?"
"Of course it's speculation. I just feel that way from the current perspective, I can't provide any concrete evidence."
"In that case, I guess. I'd like you to work hard too."
She requested cooperation half-seriously, half-jokingly.
My answer to that this time is already decided.
"If there's a situation where I can help at the end of the school year, I intend to cooperate as much as possible."
"That's a rather unusual answer for you. Between the special training and now, you've been a bit too cooperative lately. Even with the Amasawa-san situation, you didn't make a single unpleasant face."
"There are many parts that I've left to others so far. I have to lend a hand at least a little."
"That's a noble intention. But... it's still not like you. To become so cooperative."
"I wonder. There might be a catch."
"I'd rather not have that, if possible."
At this point in the conversation, Horikita and I made eye contact.
And probably, we both thought of the same thing at the same time.
"Hehe, you invited me to chat, but in the end, we're talking about the exam."

"Right. There's no point in calling you here if it's like this. Alright, let's end the discussion about the exam."
With that, I put an end to this topic.
"I heard about the results from Kushida, it seems you fought well, Amasawa, but you lost."
"She's really strong, isn't she? Even if we fought 2 against 1, we still couldn't win in the end."
However, I heard that Amasawa had evaluated the two of them after being hit a few times.
"We should be able to have a better fight next time."
"2 against 1?"
"Do you dislike it?"
"Well, yes. Ibuki-san said she wouldn't team up with me again."
"It's fine. She forgets things quickly."
Horikita laughed at my exaggeration.
"By the way, it seems that Amasawa-san noticed your influence right after the fight started. But she seemed very happy. What's your relationship with her?"
"She's my ex-girlfriend."
"Are you serious? Or is it a joke?"
"It's a bad joke."
"If that's the case, it's not funny at all."
A harsh response came back.
"Someday, I want to hear the truth from your mouth, Ayanokōji-kun."
"I'll think about it. But don't expect---"
"I'm not."
Horikita narrowed her eyes and smiled in response.
In a short time, Horikita, who was changing colors, showed a smile.
I guess I'm also learning a lot from Horikita.
This relationship between us will end soon.
Horikita will have some tough experiences in the future.
But she doesn't need to keep worrying.
Her growth and the support of her classmates should guide her.
1
Rewinding time a little from my commute to school with Horikita and the exchange meeting.
It was when Hashimoto came to my room asking for help a little before the exchange meeting.
Why did Hashimoto, who seemed reckless at first glance, betray us?
Why did he take the risk at that timing?
The circumstances were explained in detail by the person himself.
"---Before I tell you what's next, there's something I really need to confirm with Ayanokōji."
Hashimoto, who started off like this, must have had a strong determination.
What he wanted to confirm.
It was how much information I had at the moment.
That was an important factor that this man couldn't miss.
"I've been tempted to betray Ryūen since before the last special exam. Not just temporarily teaming up, but moving classes on the premise."
It's obvious, but there's no merit for Hashimoto, who is in Class A, to move to Ryūen's class.
Except for cases like Katsuragi who lost his place, if it was a long time ago, Class A should have established a more stable position than now.
"Of course, I didn't take such an invitation seriously at first. But right after that, I heard from Ryūen. If you don't move classes, you'll definitely regret it at the end of the school year."
"Regret? Is it because Ryūen himself is confident that he will win?"
"It seems that even you don't know. About the content of the bet that Ryūen and Sakayanagi agreed on."
"A bet, huh? I don't know if it applies, but I've heard a little about the exchange in the last uninhabited island test. Unfortunately, I don't know the details."
When I told him that, Hashimoto rubbed his fingers together and made a sound, as if to prove that this was what he wanted to confirm in advance.
"I'm glad. Then there was a reason for me to come here."
Accepting that the key points of the story matched, Hashimoto slightly raised the corners of his mouth and smiled.

And then Hashimoto detailed the bet that had been made between the two.
"When I first heard about it, I thought it was a joke, but it turns out it's serious."
"I see. So the special test of survival and dropout was when you had a reason to betray me."
It was clear at this stage that it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment idea.
"It's not unreasonable to doubt the bet itself, right? No matter how you look at it, Sakayanagi is at a disadvantage."
"That's true. But Sakayanagi wouldn't choose not to accept the bet because of the disadvantage."
He was the type who, like Ryūen, believed in his ultimate victory without a doubt.
"Do you think Sakayanagi simply conceded, or did he set certain conditions?"
Hashimoto, unable to suppress his overflowing emotions, leaned forward and asked.
"Both are possible, but the details of the bet will eventually come to light. Considering that, it must be the latter. He must have made Ryūen accumulate private points."
"That's good. That's quick. Yes, if that's the case, adjustments can be made as much as necessary."
"Who else knows about this bet besides the parties involved and Hashimoto?"
"If Ryūen isn't lying, no one. You're the fourth. Well, both would hate to leak it and have the bet disappear."
That speculation was probably correct. It would be preferable to make it public after everything has been confirmed.
The only one Ryūen had leaked to was Hashimoto, but that must have been a considerable risk.
If it was around the time the deserted island test ended, about half a year has passed since then.
"It's been a long time... until this day came."
Without telling anyone the secret, Hashimoto had been worrying alone.
"Whether Sakayanagi wins or Ryūen wins. Honestly, I couldn't make a judgment... well, I thought Sakayanagi might win a little."
Hashimoto immediately corrected himself as if he had lied for a moment.
"But even then, it's like 55 to 45. Seriously, it's not decisive, is it?"
I agree with that.
Unless it's 9 to 1 or at worst 7 to 3, you can't tell which way the game will go.
"So I've been looking for a decisive factor. And what I thought would be the decisive factor was---"
Slowly, Hashimoto's gaze turned to me.
"Me?"
"If Ayanokōji would follow Sakayanagi, I was ready to die with my current class without hesitation. That's why I advised Sakayanagi... to recruit me as a comrade."
And Sakayanagi refused.
So he decided to betray...?
While this story seems to make sense, the core part is still unclear.
I understand that the outcome of the confrontation between Sakayanagi and Ryūen is unpredictable.
I understand that he thought Sakayanagi could win if I joined.
But that doesn't change the fact that it's too reckless.
"I will make Ryūen win. No matter what the content of the end-of-year special test is, I will thoroughly assist. If I miss this opportunity, I will most likely be the one to disappear."
Of course, Sakayanagi will be on high alert for Hashimoto and will not share any information.
But if there is a confirmed traitor from the class, it will inevitably be a handicap.
If the total points of all classmates' tests determine the outcome, it would be a tough situation if Hashimoto intentionally scored zero.
"If Sakayanagi had followed my instructions, I was planning to betray Ryūen and join Sakayanagi at the end of the year. Whether that was before or after I betrayed in the previous special test."
I don't know how much of what he's saying with such determination is true.
Right now, the only thing I can be sure of from Hashimoto's words is that everything he's saying is ambiguous.
"It's fine if you want to make Ryūen win, but have you made the same proposal to Sakayanagi?"
"You mean about recruiting Ayanokōji? Yes, of course. The answer was the same as Sakayanagi's. But there was a condition. If I could defeat Sakayanagi in the end-of-year exam, he would recruit Ayanokōji and me to his class."
Ryūen said that?
Considering the past, Ryūen is the same as Sakayanagi.
It's clear that he's not the kind of person who would try to win by recruiting me.
And it would take a whopping 40 million to recruit two students from another class.
Did Hashimoto get fooled by Ryūen's naive lie?
No---that's probably not it.

Hashimoto in front of me wasn't telling the whole truth.
If I were Hashimoto, I would make sure to have a safety net in place for my reckless betrayal. I wouldn't make the decision to betray based on the possibility that AyanokōjiKiyotaka might move to the class I had in mind.
It would be strange if the reward for betraying Sakayanagi wasn't enormous.
The contract to transfer 20 million private points---
That would make sense.
If I helped defeat Sakayanagi in the end-of-year exam and took the credit, I could get that right from Ryūen.
This would be worth the challenge, even at the cost of betrayal.
Even if I couldn't prepare that large sum for Ryūen right away, I could collect the private points that come into the class every month, and it would be enough to pay by graduation.
In the end, it didn't really matter to Hashimoto which class won or where I was. If he had the right to become Class A, that would be Hashimoto's victory.
Everything was for himself.
The answer chosen from the patterns simulated in his head.
By betraying in the special test of survival and dropout, Hashimoto confirmed Sakayanagi's true intentions.
If he decided to accept me here, the flow would be simple. If he collected private points from all the members of Class A, there was a high possibility that he could easily reach 20 million points. If I accepted the class change, Hashimoto should choose the path to fight with Sakayanagi and me as the two main players.
If he was rejected, he could make a secret agreement with Ryūen and get 20 million private points. However, the latter has an advantage in terms of graduating from Class A, but he cannot avoid taking the risk of expulsion due to his betrayal. Not only would Sakayanagi become an enemy, but he would also be at risk of being targeted by a third party.
The reason he approached me and told me the details of the betrayal was all for himself.
"What do you want from me?"
When I asked, Hashimoto smiled nervously.
2
With the end of the exchange camp, in the slowly but surely passing time.
Sakayanagi was quietly spending time waiting for someone to come, sitting on the sofa in the career counseling room.
Next to her stood her homeroom teacher, Mashima, with his arms crossed in puzzlement.
"What are you planning to talk about with whom here?"
Mashima, who had been brought here without being told anything, sent a questioning glance.
Even if he didn't understand the situation, he definitely felt something different from usual.
"You seem restless, Mashima-sensei. Don't worry, you'll understand soon."
"But..."
More than 10 minutes had passed since the two of them entered the room.
"---Here he comes."
Sakayanagi sensed it immediately after.
The moment a hand was placed on the door, she knew that man would appear.
"You're five minutes late, Ryūen-kun."
"The star of the show always makes a late entrance."
The one who opened the door to the counseling room was Ryūen Kakeru.
And behind him was the figure of his homeroom teacher, Sakagami.
"What's going on here, Mashima-sensei?"
"Well... I'm also trying to gauge the situation."
The two teachers who ran into each other couldn't understand the situation and looked at each other in wonder.
Ryūen sat down in front of the sofa where Sakayanagi was sitting, spreading his legs wide.
An odd situation was created where two students were sitting and the teacher was standing.
"Even if you were to deceive Hashimoto-kun, you made him do something quite bold."
When Sakayanagi asked, Ryūen immediately responded.
"He must be feeling insecure under you, can't blame him."
"That would be fine. But he must have been tempted by the sweet words of a cunning villain. He believes lies to be true and truth to be lies. He might be another victim."
The exchange of words between the two began, leaving the teachers behind.
"You seem energetic for someone who's down."
"It's true that I felt emotions I've never experienced before. But if you thought that was the end, you were premature."
"Heh. Ayanokōji did something unnecessary too."
Ryūen naturally grasped the fact that Ayanokōji had approached Sakayanagi at the exchange meeting.

After the exchange meeting, Sakayanagi had regrouped.
No complex reasoning was needed to connect that.
"As you say---I was saved by him...by Ayanokōji-kun"
Taking Sakayanagi's gaze head-on, Ryūen felt it on his skin.
A change in her gaze, which until now had only looked down on others.
Sakayanagi also felt it.
The man in front of her held a belief that had grown even larger than when they first met.
"So you were also saved by Ayanokōji-kun"
"Huh, don't make me laugh. We'll never get along. I don't remember being saved by Ayanokōji. Rather, I received hatred. Hatred for revenge"
His trampled strength and pride.
He had been defeated miserably in the ring where he had absolute confidence.
"I see, hatred. So that's what drove you here"
"Are you any different?"
In response to Ryūen's counter-question, Sakayanagi inadvertently smiled.
"What's so funny"
"I'm sorry. If it seemed like a rude smile, I apologize. I was simply happy. That you have come to realize Ayanokōji-kun's strength in the process of getting here"
Unlike when he was furious with Hashimoto, the Ryūen in front of her had experienced it firsthand.
She thought he was qualified.
No, Sakayanagi immediately revised her current thought. It's not just that.
She felt a change in the switch of her emotions within her, starting with the incident involving Kamuro and Yamamura.
"Are you saying you had your eye on him earlier?"
Originally, it was a well-known fact that Sakayanagi had been paying attention to Ayanokōji.
But Ryūen didn't know where their first contact was, so he tried to find out.
"Yes. Unlike you, who unfortunately only learned of his existence at this school, I have been following him with my own eyes since childhood"
At such a triumphant attitude, Ryūen's movement stopped.
"...That's an interesting statement. You know about his childhood?"
"I know it well. I interpret it as something like a childhood friend"
Upon hearing that statement, Mashima also remembered the story Sakayanagi had told him before.
And there was nothing more rude than interrupting the two of them.
"I lost to Ayanokōji. I thought it was okay to lose as many times as I wanted as long as I won in the end, but that man mercilessly crushed that indomitable spirit. I was so drained"
But after more than a year, he was trying to return to that stage.
"Although our motives are different, it seems that our final goals are the same, Ryūen-kun. I have been wishing to fight him since long before you. We only have one year left of our school life. I need to get rid of any obstacles before then"
"I completely agree. I'll defeat you quickly and take my revenge on him"
Sakayanagi, who had always looked at others with cold eyes, certainly felt her heart warming up.
Not towards Ryūen. Because she was thinking of Ayanokōji, who was waiting ahead.
Ryūen felt the same way. His emotions were rising to defeat Ayanokōji, who was waiting beyond Sakayanagi.
"Your revenge will not be fulfilled. You will stumble just before it"
"You're probably planning to face off in the throne, but that plan will fail"
Unable to remain silent in the face of the escalating exchange, Mashima intervened.
"You seem to be moving the conversation along on your own, but could you explain the situation?"
"I apologize"
In response to the slightly indignant Mashima, Sakayanagi apologized softly. Then she opened her mouth.
"It would be better not to waste any more time. Shall we get to the point?"
"Yeah, that's right"
Sakayanagi lined up the two teachers and turned them towards her.
In front of Sakayanagi, who stood up while poking her cane, Ryūen also stood up and turned around.
"We are about to make a big bet. Normally, we would make some kind of promise verbally for ordinary things. If we can't trust each other, we would make a contract. But this time, because of the nature of the content, we decided it would be safer to have the teachers in charge of both classes present"
From the course of the conversation they had heard, both Mashima and Sakagami felt tense.

"What are you planning to decide among yourselves?"
Sakayanagi declared the content of the bet.
"The end-of-year exam, the loser leaves this school---that's what it is."
"The loser leaves...? What are you talking about? The content and rules of the exam haven't been announced yet. We don't even know if there's a mechanism to expel students at this stage."
He answered roughly, confused but aware there was no guarantee of expulsion from his opponent.
"Mashima-sensei, what are you misunderstanding? The content and rules are irrelevant. We are only betting on the outcome of the end-of-year special exam. As a result, the loser will voluntarily drop out. That's all there is to it."
"You made us teachers witnesses to ensure certainty. Even if Sakayanagi cries and screams, proceed with the expulsion process according to the contract. Of course, the same applies if I lose by any chance."
Both parties accepted the dangerous condition of accepting expulsion upon defeat, cutting off 100% of their retreat.
The cooperation of the school, which has coercive power, was indispensable for smooth execution.
Mashima, who had swallowed the situation, tried to speak, but the words didn't come out immediately.
"Do you really intend to make such a bet? You have a Protection Point---"
Compared to Mashima, the calmer Sakagami voiced his doubts.
"Protection Point has no meaning in voluntary withdrawal. For fairness, it has been decided to require additional private points to fill the gap in Protection Points, but the amount is kept to a minimum. If we take away his money, his class will really have nothing left."
"It's counting your chickens before they hatch. If you lose, there's no need to calculate money."
Mashima understood that this was not a joke, and that the contract to be made was serious.
He straightened his posture and made a stern expression.
"Are both of you really okay with this? If we agree, we will have to enforce the expulsion forcibly based on the end-of-year results. Both are important positions that play the role of leaders for the class. Major confusion is inevitable."
"Yes. It will be virtually impossible to repair the defeated class, and it will be impossible to avoid dropping out of the four-way battle before advancing to the third year."
As she said these words, Sakayanagi thought of Ayanokōji again.
The competition between the four classes that Ayanokōji idealized had become impossible when the bet with Ryūen was decided. Even if Ayanokōji transferred and steered towards balancing the forces, considering the declining Ichinose class, there would not be enough hands.
"Please don't hope for a draw to invalidate the bet, okay?"
"I don't recognize a draw. If that happens, we can decide by lottery, like you abandoned Kamuro."
"That's also fun. Let's look forward to it."
Both parties cut off their retreat, but they did not anticipate a draw from the beginning.
All there is is victory or defeat.
Only the relationship of two sides of the same coin.
The bet was officially established when Sakayanagi and Ryūen acknowledged it, and both homeroom teachers understood it.
The loser disappears.
The end-of-year special exam with no escape, betting on expulsion---is about to begin.
Afterword
Somehow, I was able to release this in four months, I'm Kinugasa with a hernia.
Thank you all for your support this year as well.
A year really goes by quickly, and before I know it, one of my children will be starting elementary school this spring.
I believe that playing with all their might every day at kindergarten or daycare is a social role for children, but the fact that they are about to jump into a society that includes studying... As a parent, I'm half excited and half worried.
Well, let's put my story aside for now and talk a little about 'Youjitsu'.
Following the previous time, the story has entered the third term of the second year. After the hard development of the previous time, this time I delivered it with a slightly loose feeling.
And next time, it will finally be the last special exam of the second year, the end-of-year special exam.
Those who have already finished reading the main story will understand, but I am planning a story that will greatly affect the main characters up to this point.
And currently, the 'Youjitsu' TV anime 3rd Season is airing.
I would be happy if you could check that out as well!
Finally... As I wrote at the beginning, about the condition of my herniated neck.
These days, there's nothing I can do about it, and my work pace is quite down. The pain is so severe that I hate sitting in a chair.
When I was healthy, if the ratio of work time was 6 and rest time was 4, I made it 9 for work and 1 for rest to somehow cover the slowdown.
But there's no way I can keep this ratio forever, and I think my body is at its limit...
So I'm considering taking a little complete rest in the future and focusing on recovery.
In that case, the release of the next volume may be delayed.
I intend to work harder than ever when I recover, so I would appreciate your understanding.
'Youjitsu' is of course the first priority. But I have many other things I want to do besides that.

Well then, everyone, hoping for the quickest possible reunion---see you again!
